## <a name="overview"></a>Overview

The Power BI data model appears to be designed for a project management and timesheet tracking system within an organization. It likely serves to analyze employee work hours, project allocations, and overall resource utilization. The presence of tables such as 'vw_Timesheet' and 'vw_missing_timesheet' suggests a focus on capturing and reporting on timesheet data, including identifying any discrepancies or missing entries. The inclusion of lookup tables like 'lkp_Project', 'lkp_Unit', and 'lkp_Code' indicates a structured approach to categorizing and filtering data related to projects, organizational units, and timesheet codes, which enhances the model's analytical capabilities.

The 'DimDate' table serves as a central date dimension, allowing for time-based analysis across various metrics, such as hours worked and project timelines. Relationships between the timesheet views and the lookup tables facilitate detailed reporting on employee performance, project progress, and resource allocation over time. Overall, this data model is likely aimed at providing insights into operational efficiency, project management effectiveness, and workforce productivity, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions based on comprehensive data analysis.
