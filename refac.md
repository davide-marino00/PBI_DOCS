```DAX
VAR ActiveEmployees = 
    FILTER(
        SUMMARIZE(
            vw_missing_timesheet,
            vw_missing_timesheet[EmployeeName],
            vw_missing_timesheet[Year_],
            vw_missing_timesheet[Week_],
            lkp_Unit[Unit],
            vw_missing_timesheet[SubUnit],
            "MissingHours", SUM(vw_missing_timesheet[Hours_]) - MAX(vw_missing_timesheet[ContractHours]),
            "MinActiveEmp", MIN(vw_missing_timesheet[CC_ActiveEmployees])
        ),
        [MinActiveEmp] = 1 && [MissingHours] < 0
    )

RETURN 
    SUMX(ActiveEmployees, [MissingHours])
```

This formula first creates a variable `ActiveEmployees` that filters a summarized table of `vw_missing_timesheet` for employees with at least one active status and negative missing hours. It then calculates the sum of missing hours for these active employees.

**Formula:**  
```DAX
DISTINCT_COUNT_EMP = DISTINCTCOUNT(vw_Timesheet[EmployeeName])
```

**Format:**  
The result is formatted as a general number (0).

#### Measure: `ExpectedContractHoursWeekly`

### Measure: ExpectedContractHoursWeekly

**Purpose:**  
The `ExpectedContractHoursWeekly` measure calculates the total expected contract hours for each employee on a weekly basis, based on the maximum contract hours recorded in the `vw_missing_timesheet` table.

**Calculation Logic:**  
The measure uses the `SUMX` function to iterate over a summarized table created by `SUMMARIZE`, which groups the data by `Week_` and `EmployeeID`. For each group, it retrieves the maximum value of `ContractHours`. The final result is the sum of these maximum contract hours across all groups.

**Formula:**
```DAX
SUMX(
    SUMMARIZE(
        vw_missing_timesheet,

MSR_ProjectMargin = SUM(vw_Timesheet[SalesAmount]) - SUM(vw_Timesheet[CostAmount])
```

This formula sums the `SalesAmount` from the `vw_Timesheet` table and subtracts the sum of `CostAmount` from the same table, resulting in the project margin. 

**Format Hint:**  
The measure is annotated with a format hint indicating it is a general number.

#### Measure: `Msr_SalesPriceBaseCurrency`

### Measure: Msr_SalesPriceBaseCurrency

**Purpose:**  
The `Msr_SalesPriceBaseCurrency` measure calculates the total sales price in the base currency for each project and client combination.

**Calculation Logic:**  
The measure uses the `SUMX` function to iterate over a summarized table created from the `vw_Timesheet` table. It groups the data by `ProjectProfile` and `Client`, and for each group, it retrieves the selected value of `SalesPriceBaseCurrency` from the `tbl_Project` table. The final result is the sum of these selected values.

**Formula:**
```DAX
SUMX(
    SUMMARIZE(
        vw_Timesheet, 
        vw_Timesheet[ProjectProfile], 
        vw_Timesheet[Client], 
        "MeasureValue", SELECTEDVALUE(tbl_Project[SalesPriceBaseCurrency])
    ), 
    [MeasureValue]
)
```

**Format:**  
The measure is formatted as currency with the following format string: `\$#,0.###############;(\$#,0.###############);\$#,0.###############`.

**Currency Culture:**  
The measure uses the currency culture set to "en-US".

#### Measure: `PercentageCompleteness`

### Measure: PercentageCompleteness

**Purpose:**  
The `PercentageCompleteness` measure calculates the completeness percentage of missing hours in relation to the expected contracted hours for a given period.

**Calculation Logic:**  
The measure is defined as follows:

```DAX
DIVIDE(
    SUM(vw_missing_timesheet[MissingHours]) - [ExpectedContractHoursWeekly],
    [ExpectedContractHoursWeekly],
    0
)
```

This formula computes the difference between the total missing hours and the expected contracted hours for the week, then divides that difference by the expected contracted hours. If the expected contracted hours are zero, it returns zero to avoid division by zero errors. 

**Format:**  
The measure is formatted as a general number.

#### Measure: `Static Total Employees`

### Measure: 'Static Total Employees'

**Purpose:**  
The 'Static Total Employees' measure calculates the total number of distinct employees whose contract status is currently valid.

**Calculation Logic:**  
The measure uses the following DAX formula:

```DAX
CALCULATE(
    DISTINCTCOUNT(vw_Timesheet[EmployeeName]), 
    ALL(vw_Timesheet),
    vw_Timesheet[ContractStatusToday] = "Valid"
)
```

This formula counts the distinct employee names in the `vw_Timesheet` table while ignoring any filters on the table and only includes those employees whose `ContractStatusToday` is "Valid". 

**Format:**  
The measure is formatted as a general number (0).

#### Measure: `TotalActualHours`

### Measure: TotalActualHours

**Purpose:**  
The `TotalActualHours` measure calculates the total number of hours recorded in the `vw_Timesheet` table.

**Calculation Logic:**  
The measure is defined using the following DAX formula:

```DAX
SUM(vw_Timesheet[Hours])
```

This formula sums up all the values in the `Hours` column of the `vw_Timesheet` table.

**Format Hint:**  
The measure is formatted as a general number.

#### Measure: `TotalContractedHours`

### Measure: TotalContractedHours

**Purpose:**  
The `TotalContractedHours` measure calculates the total contracted hours for employees based on their maximum hours per week.

**Calculation Logic:**  
The measure uses the `SUMX` function to iterate over a distinct list of employee names from the `vw_Timesheet` table, retrieving the maximum hours per week for each employee. The formula is as follows:

```DAX
SUMX(
    VALUES(vw_Timesheet[EmployeeName]),
    MAX(vw_Timesheet[HoursPerWeek])
)
```

**Format:**  
The result is formatted as a general number.

#### Measure: `TotalHoursDeltaComplete`

### Measure: TotalHoursDeltaComplete

**Purpose:**  
The `TotalHoursDeltaComplete` measure calculates the ratio of actual hours worked to the total contracted hours, providing insight into the completion status of hours relative to what was contracted.

**Calculation Logic:**  
The measure is defined using the following DAX formula:

```DAX
TotalHoursDeltaComplete =
    DIVIDE(
        [TotalActualHours],
        [TotalContractedHours],
        0
    )
```

This formula divides the total actual hours (`TotalActualHours`) by the total contracted hours (`TotalContractedHours`). If the denominator is zero, it returns 0 to avoid division errors.

**Format:**  
The result is formatted as a percentage with two decimal places, represented as `0.00%;-0.00%;0.00%`.

#### Measure: `TotalHoursDeltaCompleteNr`

### Measure: TotalHoursDeltaCompleteNr

**Purpose:**  
The `TotalHoursDeltaCompleteNr` measure calculates the difference between the total actual hours worked and the total contracted hours.

**Calculation Logic:**  
The measure is defined as follows:

```DAX
[TotalActualHours] - [TotalContractedHours]
```

This formula subtracts the total contracted hours from the total actual hours, providing a numerical representation of the difference between hours worked and hours contracted. 

**Format Hint:**  
The measure is formatted as a general number.

#### Measure: `TotalHoursTracked`

### Measure: TotalHoursTracked

**Purpose:**  
The `TotalHoursTracked` measure calculates the total hours tracked from the `vw_Timesheet` table. It ensures that if there are no hours recorded, the result will default to zero.

**Calculation Logic:**  
The measure uses the following DAX formula:

```DAX
IF (
    ISBLANK(SUM(vw_Timesheet[Hours])),
    0,
    SUM(vw_Timesheet[Hours])
)
```

This formula checks if the sum of hours is blank. If it is, the measure returns 0; otherwise, it returns the total sum of hours tracked. 

**Format Hint:**  
The measure is formatted as a general number.

#### Measure: `TotalHoursTrackedMissing`

### Measure: TotalHoursTrackedMissing

**Purpose:**  
The `TotalHoursTrackedMissing` measure is designed to evaluate the total hours tracked in the timesheet, providing a clear indication of whether any hours have been recorded.

```DAX
IF (
    ISBLANK(SUM(vw_Timesheet[Hours])),
    "Empty",
    SUM(vw_Timesheet[Hours])
)
```

This formula checks if the sum of hours from the `vw_Timesheet` table is blank. If it is blank, the measure returns the string "Empty"; otherwise, it returns the total sum of hours tracked.

#### Measure: `trackedDiff`

### Measure: trackedDiff

**Purpose:**  
The `trackedDiff` measure calculates the difference between the total hours tracked and the maximum hours per week for each employee, providing insight into discrepancies in reported hours.

**Calculation Logic:**  
The measure is defined as follows:

```DAX
[TotalHoursTracked] - 
    CALCULATE(
        MAXX(DISTINCT(vw_Timesheet[HoursPerWeek]), vw_Timesheet[HoursPerWeek]),
        ALLEXCEPT(vw_Timesheet, vw_Timesheet[EmployeeID])
    )
```

- It subtracts the maximum hours per week (considering distinct values) from the total hours tracked for each employee, while maintaining the context of the employee ID.

#### Measure: `trackedDiff2`

### Measure: trackedDiff2

**Purpose:**  
The `trackedDiff2` measure calculates the difference between the total hours tracked and the maximum hours per week for each employee, while removing filters on the `HoursPerWeek` column.

**Calculation Logic:**  
The measure is defined as follows:

```DAX
[TotalHoursTracked] - 
    CALCULATE(
        MAXX(
            DISTINCT(vw_Timesheet[HoursPerWeek]), 
            vw_Timesheet[HoursPerWeek]
        ),
        REMOVEFILTERS(vw_Timesheet[HoursPerWeek]),
        ALLEXCEPT(vw_Timesheet, vw_Timesheet[EmployeeID])
    )
```

This formula computes the difference by taking the total hours tracked and subtracting the maximum distinct hours per week for the employee, ensuring that the calculation is not affected by filters on `HoursPerWeek` but retains the context of the specific employee.

#### Measure: `UniqueEmployeesPerUnit`

### Measure: UniqueEmployeesPerUnit

**Purpose:**  
The `UniqueEmployeesPerUnit` measure calculates the number of unique employees per unit based on their incomplete status within a specified week.

**Calculation Logic:**  
The measure uses the `SUMX` function in conjunction with `SUMMARIZE` to group data from the `vw_missing_timesheet` table by week, employee name, and main unit. It retrieves the maximum value of the `IncompleteFlag` for each group, effectively counting unique employees who have an incomplete status.

**Formula:**  
```DAX
SUMX(
    SUMMARIZE(
        vw_missing_timesheet,
        vw_missing_timesheet[Week_],
        vw_missing_timesheet[EmployeeName],
        vw_missing_timesheet[MAIN_UNIT],
        "IncompleteFlag", MAX(vw_missing_timesheet[IncompleteFlag])
    ),
    [IncompleteFlag]
)
```

**Format:**  
The measure is formatted as a general number (0).

#### Measure: `UTI_TotalBillableHours`

### Measure: UTI_TotalBillableHours

**Purpose:**  
The `UTI_TotalBillableHours` measure calculates the total billable hours from the `vw_Timesheet` table, specifically for projects that qualify as billable.

**Calculation Logic:**  
The measure filters the `vw_Timesheet` table to include only those entries where either:
- The `QualifyPrj` column is equal to 1 and the `BillablePrj` column is also equal to 1, or
- The `Project` column contains the phrase "Customer Success Services".

It then sums the `Hours` for the filtered entries.

**Formula:**
```DAX
Var FilteredHours =
    Filter(
        vw_Timesheet,
        (
        vw_Timesheet[QualifyPrj] = 1 && 
        vw_Timesheet[BillablePrj] = 1) ||
            SEARCH("Customer Success Services", vw_Timesheet[Project], 1, 0) > 0
    )
RETURN 
    SUMX(FilteredHours, vw_Timesheet[Hours])
```

**Format:**  
The measure is formatted as a general number (0).

#### Measure: `UTI_TOTALHOURS`

### Measure: UTI_TOTALHOURS

**Purpose:**  
The `UTI_TOTALHOURS` measure calculates the total hours worked by employees on projects that qualify for tracking.

**Calculation Logic:**  
The measure uses the `CALCULATE` function to sum the `Hours` from the `vw_Timesheet` table, applying a filter to include only those records where the `QualifyPrj` column is equal to 1.

**Formula:**  
```DAX
UTI_TOTALHOURS = CALCULATE(SUM(vw_Timesheet[Hours]), vw_Timesheet[QualifyPrj] = 1)
```

**Format Hint:**  
The measure is formatted as a general number.

#### Measure: `UTILIZATION_New`

### DAX Measure: UTILIZATION_New

**Purpose:**  
The `UTILIZATION_New` measure calculates the ratio of billable hours to total hours for active employees, providing insight into employee utilization rates.

**Calculation Logic:**  
The measure uses the following logic:

1. It defines two variables:
   - `_TotalBillableHours`: This retrieves the total billable hours from the `UTI_TotalBillableHours` measure.
   - `_TotalHours`: This retrieves the total hours from the `UTI_TOTALHOURS` measure.

2. The measure checks if the number of active contacts (`Msr_ActiveContacts`) is not blank. If true, it further checks if `_TotalHours` is not blank. 

3. If both conditions are satisfied, it calculates the utilization ratio by dividing `_TotalBillableHours` by `_TotalHours`. If the division results in a blank value, it returns 0.

**Formula:**
```DAX
VAR _TotalBillableHours = [UTI_TotalBillableHours]
VAR _TotalHours = [UTI_TOTALHOURS]

RETURN
    IF(NOT(ISBLANK([Msr_ActiveContacts])), 
        IF(NOT(ISBLANK([UTI_TOTALHOURS])), 
            IF(ISBLANK(DIVIDE(_TotalBillableHours, _TotalHours)), 0, DIVIDE(_TotalBillableHours, _TotalHours))
        )
    )
```

**Format:**  
0.00%;-0.00%;0.00%
