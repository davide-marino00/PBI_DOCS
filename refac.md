## <a name="overview"></a>Overview

The Power BI data model appears to be designed for a business domain focused on project management and timesheet tracking, likely within a professional services or project-based organization. The presence of tables such as 'vw_Timesheet' and 'vw_missing_timesheet' suggests a strong emphasis on monitoring employee hours worked against various projects, units, and codes, which are essential for resource allocation, billing, and performance analysis. The inclusion of dimension tables like 'DimDate' and lookup tables ('lkp_Project', 'lkp_Unit', 'lkp_Code', 'lkp_fltr_Employee') indicates a structured approach to categorizing and filtering data for insightful reporting.

The relationships established between these tables facilitate comprehensive analysis of timesheet data, allowing users to track project progress, identify missing timesheets, and evaluate employee contributions over time. By linking timesheet entries to specific projects, units, and dates, the model supports detailed reporting capabilities that can help management make informed decisions regarding project staffing, budget adherence, and overall operational efficiency. This structure not only aids in compliance and accountability but also enhances strategic planning and resource management within the organization.
