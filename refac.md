## 1. Overview

This documentation provides a high-level overview of a data model designed for reporting and analysis within a business intelligence context, specifically utilizing Power BI. The primary purpose of this model is to aggregate and summarize key financial and operational metrics, such as sales amounts, hours worked, and employee activity, to facilitate informed decision-making and performance tracking.

The model comprises several components, including various data columns and measures that capture essential business metrics. Key items include the summation of sales prices and amounts, active employee calculations, and various measures for project margins and realization percentages. The report focuses on visualizing these metrics through pivot tables, allowing users to analyze data across different dimensions such as time (calendar year and week), project details, and employee contributions. The complexity of the model is enhanced by the use of DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for dynamic calculations, ensuring that the data remains relevant and actionable for stakeholders.
