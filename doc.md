            vw_missing_timesheet[Year_],
            vw_missing_timesheet[Week_],
            lkp_Unit[Unit],
            vw_missing_timesheet[SubUnit],
            "MissingHours", SUM(vw_missing_timesheet[Hours_]) - MAX(vw_missing_timesheet[ContractHours]),
            "MinActiveEmp", MIN(vw_missing_timesheet[CC_ActiveEmployees])
        ),
        [MinActiveEmp] = 1 && [MissingHours] < 0
    )

RETURN 
    SUMX(ActiveEmployees, [MissingHours])
```

This formula first creates a variable `ActiveEmployees` that filters a summarized table of `vw_missing_timesheet` for employees with at least one active status and negative missing hours. It then returns the sum of the missing hours for these active employees. 

**Format:**  
The measure is formatted as a general number.

    SUM(vw_Timesheet[Hours])
)
```

This formula checks if the sum of the `Hours` column in the `vw_Timesheet` table is blank. If it is blank, the measure returns the string "Empty"; otherwise, it returns the total sum of hours tracked. 

**Format Hint:**  
The measure is formatted as a general number.

#### Measure: `UTILIZATION_New`

### DAX Measure: UTILIZATION_New

**Purpose:**  
The `UTILIZATION_New` measure calculates the ratio of billable hours to total hours for active employees, providing insight into employee utilization rates.

**Calculation Logic:**  
The measure uses the following logic:
1. It retrieves the total billable hours from the `UTI_TotalBillableHours` measure.
2. It retrieves the total hours from the `UTI_TOTALHOURS` measure.
3. It checks if there are active contacts (employees) and if the total hours are not blank.
4. If the conditions are met, it calculates the ratio of total billable hours to total hours. If the division results in a blank, it returns 0.

**Formula:**
```DAX
VAR _TotalBillableHours = [UTI_TotalBillableHours]
VAR _TotalHours = [UTI_TOTALHOURS]

RETURN
    IF(NOT(ISBLANK([Msr_ActiveContacts])), 
        IF(NOT(ISBLANK([UTI_TOTALHOURS])), 
            IF(ISBLANK(DIVIDE(_TotalBillableHours, _TotalHours)), 0, DIVIDE(_TotalBillableHours, _TotalHours))
        )
    )
```

```DAX
Var FilteredHours =
    Filter(
        vw_Timesheet,
        (
        vw_Timesheet[QualifyPrj] = 1 && 
        vw_Timesheet[BillablePrj] = 1) ||
            SEARCH("Customer Success Services", vw_Timesheet[Project], 1, 0) > 0
    )
RETURN 
    SUMX(FilteredHours, vw_Timesheet[Hours])
```

This formula filters the `vw_Timesheet` table to include only those entries where the project qualifies as billable or is related to "Customer Success Services," and then sums the hours for those filtered entries.

        ALLEXCEPT(vw_Timesheet, vw_Timesheet[EmployeeID])
    )
```

- It subtracts the maximum hours per week (considering distinct values) from the total hours tracked for each employee, while maintaining the context of the employee ID.

#### Measure: `trackedDiff2`

### Measure: trackedDiff2

**Purpose:**  
The `trackedDiff2` measure calculates the difference between the total hours tracked and the maximum hours per week for each employee, while removing filters on the `HoursPerWeek` column.

**Calculation Logic:**  
The measure is defined as follows:

```DAX
[TotalHoursTracked] - 
    CALCULATE(
        MAXX(
            DISTINCT(vw_Timesheet[HoursPerWeek]), 
            vw_Timesheet[HoursPerWeek]
        ),
        REMOVEFILTERS(vw_Timesheet[HoursPerWeek]),
        ALLEXCEPT(vw_Timesheet, vw_Timesheet[EmployeeID])
    )
```

This formula computes the total hours tracked and subtracts the maximum distinct hours per week for the employee, ensuring that any filters on `HoursPerWeek` are ignored while maintaining the context of the specific employee.
