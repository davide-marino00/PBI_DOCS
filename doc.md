The `TotalActualHours` measure calculates the total number of hours recorded in the `vw_Timesheet` table.

**Formula:**  
```DAX
TotalActualHours = SUM(vw_Timesheet[Hours])
```

**Format Hint:**  
- This measure is formatted as a general number.

#### Measure: `TotalContractedHours`

### Measure: TotalContractedHours

**Purpose:**  
Calculates the total contracted hours for each employee by summing the maximum hours per week across all employees.

**Formula:**  
```DAX
SUMX(
    VALUES(vw_Timesheet[EmployeeName]),
    MAX(vw_Timesheet[HoursPerWeek])
)
```

**Format:**  
0 (General Number)

#### Measure: `TotalHoursDeltaComplete`

### DAX Measure: TotalHoursDeltaComplete

**Purpose:**  
The `TotalHoursDeltaComplete` measure calculates the ratio of actual hours worked to contracted hours, providing insight into the completion status of hours relative to what was contracted.

**Formula:**  
```DAX
TotalHoursDeltaComplete = 
    DIVIDE(
        [TotalActualHours],
        [TotalContractedHours],
        0
    )
```

**Format:**  
- Displayed as a percentage with two decimal places: `0.00%;-0.00%;0.00%`

#### Measure: `TotalHoursDeltaCompleteNr`

### DAX Measure: TotalHoursDeltaCompleteNr

**Purpose:**  
The measure `TotalHoursDeltaCompleteNr` calculates the difference between the total actual hours worked and the total contracted hours for employees. This measure helps in assessing whether the actual hours worked exceed or fall short of the contracted hours.

**Formula:**  
```DAX
[TotalActualHours] - [TotalContractedHours]
```

**Format Hint:**  
- General Number (isGeneralNumber: true)

#### Measure: `TotalHoursTracked`

### DAX Measure: TotalHoursTracked

**Purpose:**  
The `TotalHoursTracked` measure calculates the total hours tracked from the `vw_Timesheet` table. It ensures that if there are no hours recorded, the measure returns zero instead of a blank value.

**Formula:**  
```DAX
IF (
    ISBLANK(SUM(vw_Timesheet[Hours])),
    0,
    SUM(vw_Timesheet[Hours])
)
```

**Format Hint:**  
- General Number (isGeneralNumber: true)

#### Measure: `TotalHoursTrackedMissing`

### DAX Measure: TotalHoursTrackedMissing

**Purpose:**  
The measure `TotalHoursTrackedMissing` is designed to evaluate the total hours tracked in the `vw_Timesheet` table. It specifically checks if the sum of hours is blank and returns a specific message if it is.

**Formula:**  
```DAX
IF (
    ISBLANK(SUM(vw_Timesheet[Hours])),
    "Empty",
    SUM(vw_Timesheet[Hours])
)
```

**Format Hint:**  
This measure is formatted as a general number.

#### Measure: `UTILIZATION_New`

### DAX Measure: `UTILIZATION_New`

**Purpose:**  
Calculates the Billable Hour Ratio for active employees, providing insight into the utilization of hours worked on billable projects.

**Formula:**  
```DAX
VAR _TotalBillableHours = [UTI_TotalBillableHours]
VAR _TotalHours = [UTI_TOTALHOURS]

RETURN
    IF(NOT(ISBLANK([Msr_ActiveContacts])), 
        IF(NOT(ISBLANK([UTI_TOTALHOURS])), 
            IF(ISBLANK(DIVIDE(_TotalBillableHours, _TotalHours)), 0, DIVIDE(_TotalBillableHours, _TotalHours))
        )
    )
```

**Format String:**  
0.00%;-0.00%;0.00%

#### Measure: `UTI_TOTALHOURS`

### DAX Measure: UTI_TOTALHOURS

**Purpose:**  
The `UTI_TOTALHOURS` measure calculates the total hours worked by employees on projects that qualify as billable, specifically filtering for projects marked with `QualifyPrj = 1`.

**Formula:**  
```DAX
UTI_TOTALHOURS = CALCULATE(SUM(vw_Timesheet[Hours]), vw_Timesheet[QualifyPrj] = 1)
```

**Format Hint:**  
- General Number: `{"isGeneralNumber":true}`

#### Measure: `UTI_TotalBillableHours`

### DAX Measure: `UTI_TotalBillableHours`

**Purpose:**  
Calculates the total billable hours from the `vw_Timesheet` table, filtering for specific project criteria.

**Formula:**
```DAX
Var FilteredHours =
    Filter(
        vw_Timesheet,
        (
        vw_Timesheet[QualifyPrj] = 1 && 
        vw_Timesheet[BillablePrj] = 1) ||
            SEARCH("Customer Success Services", vw_Timesheet[Project], 1, 0) > 0
    )
RETURN 
    SUMX(FilteredHours, vw_Timesheet[Hours])
```

**Format:**  
- Format String: `0` (General Number)

#### Measure: `UniqueEmployeesPerUnit`

### DAX Measure: UniqueEmployeesPerUnit

**Purpose:**  
The `UniqueEmployeesPerUnit` measure calculates the number of unique employees per unit based on their weekly records in the `vw_missing_timesheet` table, specifically focusing on whether they have incomplete flags.

**Formula:**  
```DAX
SUMX(
    SUMMARIZE(
        vw_missing_timesheet,
        vw_missing_timesheet[Week_],
        vw_missing_timesheet[EmployeeName],
        vw_missing_timesheet[MAIN_UNIT],
        "IncompleteFlag", MAX(vw_missing_timesheet[IncompleteFlag])
    ),
    [IncompleteFlag]
)
```

**Format:**  
- Format String: 0 (General Number)

#### Measure: `trackedDiff`

### DAX Measure: `trackedDiff`

**Purpose:**  
The `trackedDiff` measure calculates the difference between the total hours tracked for an employee and the maximum hours per week recorded for that employee, excluding any filters on the `HoursPerWeek` column.

**Formula:**  
```DAX
[TotalHoursTracked] - 
    CALCULATE(
        MAXX(DISTINCT(vw_Timesheet[HoursPerWeek]), vw_Timesheet[HoursPerWeek]),
        ALLEXCEPT(vw_Timesheet, vw_Timesheet[EmployeeID])
    )
```

**Format Hint:**  
- General Number

#### Measure: `trackedDiff2`

### DAX Measure: `trackedDiff2`

**Purpose:**  
The `trackedDiff2` measure calculates the difference between the total hours tracked and the maximum hours per week for each employee, while removing filters on the `HoursPerWeek` column and preserving the context of the `EmployeeID`.

```DAX
[TotalHoursTracked] - 
    CALCULATE(
        MAXX(
            DISTINCT(vw_Timesheet[HoursPerWeek]), 
            vw_Timesheet[HoursPerWeek]
        ),
        REMOVEFILTERS(vw_Timesheet[HoursPerWeek]),
