            vw_missing_timesheet,
            vw_missing_timesheet[EmployeeName],
            vw_missing_timesheet[Year_],
            vw_missing_timesheet[Week_],
            lkp_Unit[Unit],
            vw_missing_timesheet[SubUnit],
            "MissingHours", SUM(vw_missing_timesheet[Hours_]) - MAX(vw_missing_timesheet[ContractHours]),
            "MinActiveEmp", MIN(vw_missing_timesheet[CC_ActiveEmployees])
        ),
        [MinActiveEmp] = 1 && [MissingHours] < 0
    )

RETURN 
    SUMX(ActiveEmployees, [MissingHours])
```

This measure first identifies active employees by filtering the summarized data from the `vw_missing_timesheet` table, where the minimum active employee count is 1 and the calculated missing hours are negative. It then sums the missing hours for these active employees.

The `Msr_SalesPriceBaseCurrency` measure calculates the total sales price in the base currency for each project and client combination.

**Calculation Logic:**  
The measure uses the `SUMX` function to iterate over a summarized table created from `vw_Timesheet`, grouping by `ProjectProfile` and `Client`. For each group, it retrieves the selected sales price from `tbl_Project[SalesPriceBaseCurrency]` using the `SELECTEDVALUE` function. The final result is the sum of these values across all groups.

**Formula:**
```DAX
SUMX(
    SUMMARIZE(
        vw_Timesheet, 
        vw_Timesheet[ProjectProfile], 
        vw_Timesheet[Client], 
        "MeasureValue", SELECTEDVALUE(tbl_Project[SalesPriceBaseCurrency])
    ), 
    [MeasureValue]
)
```

**Format:**  
The measure is formatted as currency with the following format string: `\$#,0.###############;(\$#,0.###############);\$#,0.###############`. It also has a currency culture set to "en-US".

#### Measure: `PercentageCompleteness`

### Measure: PercentageCompleteness

**Purpose:**  
The `PercentageCompleteness` measure calculates the completeness percentage of missing hours relative to the expected contracted hours for a given period.

**Calculation Logic:**  
The measure is defined as follows:

```DAX
DIVIDE(
    SUM(vw_missing_timesheet[MissingHours]) - [ExpectedContractHoursWeekly],
    [ExpectedContractHoursWeekly],
    0
)
```

This formula computes the difference between the total missing hours and the expected contracted hours for the week, then divides that difference by the expected contracted hours. If the expected contracted hours are zero, it returns zero to avoid division by zero errors.

#### Measure: `Static Total Employees`

### Measure: 'Static Total Employees'

**Purpose:**  
The 'Static Total Employees' measure calculates the total number of distinct employees whose contract status is currently valid.

**Calculation Logic:**  
The measure uses the `CALCULATE` function to count distinct employee names from the `vw_Timesheet` table while applying the following filters:
- It removes all existing filters on the `vw_Timesheet` table using `ALL(vw_Timesheet)`.
- It filters for employees where the `ContractStatusToday` is "Valid".

**DAX Formula:**
```DAX
CALCULATE(
    DISTINCTCOUNT(vw_Timesheet[EmployeeName]), 
    ALL(vw_Timesheet),
    vw_Timesheet[ContractStatusToday] = "Valid"
)
```

**Format:**  
The measure is formatted as a general number (0).

#### Measure: `TotalActualHours`

### Measure: TotalActualHours

**Purpose:**  
The `TotalActualHours` measure calculates the total number of hours recorded in the `vw_Timesheet` table.

**Calculation Logic:**  
The measure is defined using the following DAX formula:

```DAX
SUM(vw_Timesheet[Hours])
```

This formula sums up all the values in the `Hours` column of the `vw_Timesheet` table.

**Format Hint:**  
The measure is formatted as a general number.

#### Measure: `TotalContractedHours`

### Measure: TotalContractedHours

**Purpose:**  
The `TotalContractedHours` measure calculates the total number of contracted hours for employees based on their weekly hours.

**Calculation Logic:**  
The measure uses the `SUMX` function to iterate over distinct employee names in the `vw_Timesheet` table, retrieving the maximum hours per week for each employee. The formula is as follows:

```DAX
SUMX(
    VALUES(vw_Timesheet[EmployeeName]),
    MAX(vw_Timesheet[HoursPerWeek])
)
```

**Format:**  
The result is formatted as a general number.

#### Measure: `TotalHoursDeltaComplete`

### Measure: TotalHoursDeltaComplete

**Purpose:**  
The `TotalHoursDeltaComplete` measure calculates the ratio of actual hours worked to contracted hours, providing insight into the completion status of hours relative to what was contracted.

**Calculation Logic:**  
The measure is defined using the following DAX formula:

```DAX
TotalHoursDeltaComplete =
    DIVIDE(
        [TotalActualHours],
        [TotalContractedHours],
        0
    )
```

This formula divides the total actual hours (`TotalActualHours`) by the total contracted hours (`TotalContractedHours`). If the denominator is zero, it returns 0 to avoid division errors.

**Format:**  
The result is formatted as a percentage with two decimal places, represented as `0.00%;-0.00%;0.00%`.

#### Measure: `TotalHoursDeltaCompleteNr`

### Measure: TotalHoursDeltaCompleteNr

**Purpose:**  
The `TotalHoursDeltaCompleteNr` measure calculates the difference between the total actual hours worked and the total contracted hours for employees.

**Calculation Logic:**  
The measure is defined by the formula:
```DAX
[TotalActualHours] - [TotalContractedHours]
```
This formula subtracts the total contracted hours from the total actual hours, providing a numeric representation of the difference. 

**Format Hint:**  
The measure is formatted as a general number.

#### Measure: `TotalHoursTracked`

### Measure: TotalHoursTracked

**Purpose:**  
The `TotalHoursTracked` measure calculates the total hours tracked from the `vw_Timesheet` table. It ensures that if there are no hours recorded, the measure returns zero instead of a blank value.

**Calculation Logic:**  
The measure is defined as follows:

```DAX
IF (
    ISBLANK(SUM(vw_Timesheet[Hours])),
    0,
    SUM(vw_Timesheet[Hours])
)
```

This formula checks if the sum of hours is blank. If it is, the measure returns 0; otherwise, it returns the total sum of hours tracked. 

**Format Hint:**  
The measure is formatted as a general number.

#### Measure: `TotalHoursTrackedMissing`

### Measure: TotalHoursTrackedMissing

**Purpose:**  
The `TotalHoursTrackedMissing` measure is designed to evaluate the total hours tracked in the timesheet. It provides a way to identify whether the hours data is available or not.

**Calculation Logic:**  
The measure uses the following DAX formula:

```DAX
IF (
    ISBLANK(SUM(vw_Timesheet[Hours])),
    "Empty",
    SUM(vw_Timesheet[Hours])
)
```

This formula checks if the sum of hours from the `vw_Timesheet` table is blank. If it is blank, the measure returns the string "Empty"; otherwise, it returns the total sum of hours tracked. 

**Format Hint:**  
The measure is formatted as a general number.

#### Measure: `UTILIZATION_New`

### DAX Measure: UTILIZATION_New

**Purpose:**  
The `UTILIZATION_New` measure calculates the ratio of billable hours to total hours for active employees, providing insight into employee utilization rates.

**Calculation Logic:**  
The measure uses the following logic:
1. It retrieves the total billable hours using the measure `[UTI_TotalBillableHours]`.
2. It retrieves the total hours using the measure `[UTI_TOTALHOURS]`.
3. It checks if there are active contacts (`[Msr_ActiveContacts]`) and if total hours are not blank.
4. If the conditions are met, it calculates the ratio of total billable hours to total hours. If the division results in a blank, it returns 0.

**Formula:**
```DAX
VAR _TotalBillableHours = [UTI_TotalBillableHours]
VAR _TotalHours = [UTI_TOTALHOURS]

RETURN
    IF(NOT(ISBLANK([Msr_ActiveContacts])), 
        IF(NOT(ISBLANK([UTI_TOTALHOURS])), 
            IF(ISBLANK(DIVIDE(_TotalBillableHours, _TotalHours)), 0, DIVIDE(_TotalBillableHours, _TotalHours))
        )
    )
```

**Format:**  
0.00%;-0.00%;0.00%

#### Measure: `UTI_TOTALHOURS`

### Measure: UTI_TOTALHOURS

**Purpose:**  
The UTI_TOTALHOURS measure calculates the total hours worked on projects that qualify for billing.

**Calculation Logic:**  
The measure uses the `CALCULATE` function to sum the hours from the `vw_Timesheet` table, applying a filter to include only those records where the `QualifyPrj` column is equal to 1.

**Formula:**  
```DAX
UTI_TOTALHOURS = CALCULATE(SUM(vw_Timesheet[Hours]), vw_Timesheet[QualifyPrj] = 1)
```

**Format Hint:**  
The measure is formatted as a general number.

#### Measure: `UTI_TotalBillableHours`

### Measure: UTI_TotalBillableHours

**Purpose:**  
The `UTI_TotalBillableHours` measure calculates the total billable hours for projects that qualify as billable or are associated with "Customer Success Services."

**Calculation Logic:**  
The measure uses the following DAX formula:

```DAX
Var FilteredHours =
    Filter(
        vw_Timesheet,
        (
        vw_Timesheet[QualifyPrj] = 1 && 
        vw_Timesheet[BillablePrj] = 1) ||
            SEARCH("Customer Success Services", vw_Timesheet[Project], 1, 0) > 0
    )
RETURN 
    SUMX(FilteredHours, vw_Timesheet[Hours])
```

This formula filters the `vw_Timesheet` table to include only those entries where the project qualifies as billable or contains "Customer Success Services" in the project name, and then sums the hours for those filtered entries. 

**Format:**  
The result is formatted as a general number (0).

#### Measure: `UniqueEmployeesPerUnit`

### Measure: UniqueEmployeesPerUnit

**Purpose:**  
The `UniqueEmployeesPerUnit` measure calculates the number of unique employees per unit based on their weekly records in the `vw_missing_timesheet` table.

**Calculation Logic:**  
The measure uses the `SUMX` function in conjunction with `SUMMARIZE` to group the data by week, employee name, and main unit. It retrieves the maximum value of the `IncompleteFlag` for each group, effectively counting the unique employees who have an incomplete status. The formula is as follows:

```DAX
SUMX(
    SUMMARIZE(
        vw_missing_timesheet,
        vw_missing_timesheet[Week_],
        vw_missing_timesheet[EmployeeName],
        vw_missing_timesheet[MAIN_UNIT],
        "IncompleteFlag", MAX(vw_missing_timesheet[IncompleteFlag])
    ),
    [IncompleteFlag]
)
```

**Format:**  
The result is formatted as a general number (0).

#### Measure: `trackedDiff`

### Measure: trackedDiff

**Purpose:**  
The `trackedDiff` measure calculates the difference between the total hours tracked and the maximum hours per week for each employee, providing insight into discrepancies in reported hours.

**Calculation Logic:**  
The measure is defined as follows:

```DAX
[TotalHoursTracked] - 
    CALCULATE(
        MAXX(DISTINCT(vw_Timesheet[HoursPerWeek]), vw_Timesheet[HoursPerWeek]),
        ALLEXCEPT(vw_Timesheet, vw_Timesheet[EmployeeID])
    )
```

- It subtracts the maximum hours per week (considering distinct values) from the total hours tracked for each employee, while maintaining the context of the employee ID.

#### Measure: `trackedDiff2`

### Measure: trackedDiff2

**Purpose:**  
The `trackedDiff2` measure calculates the difference between the total hours tracked and the maximum hours per week for each employee, while removing filters on the `HoursPerWeek` column.

**Calculation Logic:**  
The measure is defined as follows:

```DAX
[TotalHoursTracked] - 
    CALCULATE(
        MAXX(
            DISTINCT(vw_Timesheet[HoursPerWeek]), 
            vw_Timesheet[HoursPerWeek]
        ),
        REMOVEFILTERS(vw_Timesheet[HoursPerWeek]),
        ALLEXCEPT(vw_Timesheet, vw_Timesheet[EmployeeID])
    )
```

This formula computes the total hours tracked and subtracts the maximum distinct hours per week for the employee, ensuring that the calculation is not affected by filters on `HoursPerWeek` but retains the context of the specific employee.
