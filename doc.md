**Purpose:**  
The `ContractStatus2` measure evaluates the status of a contract based on the active status determined by the `ContractStatusMeasure` and returns the difference in hours if the contract is active.

**Calculation Logic:**  
The measure uses the following DAX formula:

```DAX
IF(
    [ContractStatusMeasure] = "Active",
    [HoursDifference],
    "Not Active"
)
```

    FILTER(
        SUMMARIZE(
            vw_missing_timesheet,
            vw_missing_timesheet[EmployeeName],
            vw_missing_timesheet[Year_],
            vw_missing_timesheet[Week_],
            lkp_Unit[Unit],
            vw_missing_timesheet[SubUnit],
            "MissingHours", SUM(vw_missing_timesheet[Hours_]) - MAX(vw_missing_timesheet[ContractHours]),
            "MinActiveEmp", MIN(vw_missing_timesheet[CC_ActiveEmployees])
        ),
        [MinActiveEmp] = 1 && [MissingHours] < 0
    )

RETURN 
    SUMX(ActiveEmployees, [MissingHours])
```

This formula first creates a variable `ActiveEmployees` that filters a summarized table of `vw_missing_timesheet` for employees with at least one active status and negative missing hours. It then sums the `MissingHours` for these filtered active employees. 

**Format:**  
The measure is formatted as a general number.

#### Measure: `ExpectedContractHoursWeekly`

### Measure: ExpectedContractHoursWeekly

**Purpose:**  
The `ExpectedContractHoursWeekly` measure calculates the total expected contract hours for each employee on a weekly basis, based on the maximum contract hours recorded in the `vw_missing_timesheet` table.

    FILTER(
        ALLSELECTED(DimDate[ShortDate]),
        DimDate[ShortDate] <= MAX(DimDate[ShortDate])
    )
)
```

This formula sums the `SalesAmount` from the `vw_Timesheet` table, applying a filter to include only those dates that are less than or equal to the maximum date in the current context. The use of `ALLSELECTED` ensures that the calculation respects any filters applied to the date dimension while still allowing for cumulative aggregation.

#### Measure: `MSR_PROJECT_%_REALIZATION`

### Measure: MSR_PROJECT_%_REALIZATION

**Purpose:**

#### Measure: `Msr_SalesPriceBaseCurrency`

### Measure: Msr_SalesPriceBaseCurrency

**Purpose:**  
The `Msr_SalesPriceBaseCurrency` measure calculates the total sales price in the base currency for each project and client combination.

**Calculation Logic:**  
The measure uses the `SUMX` function to iterate over a summarized table created from `vw_Timesheet`, grouping by `ProjectProfile` and `Client`. For each group, it retrieves the selected value of `SalesPriceBaseCurrency` from the `tbl_Project` table and sums these values.

**Formula:**
```DAX
SUMX(
    SUMMARIZE(
        vw_Timesheet, 
        vw_Timesheet[ProjectProfile], 
        vw_Timesheet[Client], 
        "MeasureValue", SELECTEDVALUE(tbl_Project[SalesPriceBaseCurrency])
    ), 
    [MeasureValue]
)
```

**Format:**  
The measure is formatted as currency with the following format string: `\$#,0.###############;(\$#,0.###############);\$#,0.###############`.

**Currency Culture:**  
The measure is set to use the "en-US" currency culture.

#### Measure: `PercentageCompleteness`

### Measure: PercentageCompleteness

**Purpose:**  
The `PercentageCompleteness` measure calculates the completeness percentage of missing hours relative to the expected contracted hours for a given period.

```DAX
DIVIDE(
    SUM(vw_missing_timesheet[MissingHours]) - [ExpectedContractHoursWeekly],
    [ExpectedContractHoursWeekly],
    0
)
```

This formula computes the difference between the total missing hours and the expected contracted hours for the week, then divides that difference by the expected contracted hours. If the expected contracted hours are zero, it returns zero to avoid division by zero errors.

#### Measure: `Static Total Employees`

### Measure: 'Static Total Employees'

**Purpose:**  
The 'Static Total Employees' measure calculates the total number of distinct employees whose contract status is currently valid.

**Calculation Logic:**  
The measure uses the `CALCULATE` function to count distinct employee names from the `vw_Timesheet` table while applying the following filters:
- It removes all existing filters on the `vw_Timesheet` table using `ALL(vw_Timesheet)`.
- It filters for records where the `ContractStatusToday` is "Valid".

**DAX Formula:**
```DAX
CALCULATE(
    DISTINCTCOUNT(vw_Timesheet[EmployeeName]), 
    ALL(vw_Timesheet),
    vw_Timesheet[ContractStatusToday] = "Valid"
)
```

**Format:**  
The measure is formatted as a general number (0).

#### Measure: `TotalActualHours`

```DAX
SUMX(
    VALUES(vw_Timesheet[EmployeeName]),
    MAX(vw_Timesheet[HoursPerWeek])
)
```

**Format:**  
The result is formatted as a general number.

#### Measure: `TotalHoursDeltaComplete`

### Measure: TotalHoursDeltaComplete

**Purpose:**  
The `TotalHoursDeltaComplete` measure calculates the ratio of actual hours worked to contracted hours, providing insight into the completion status of hours relative to what was contracted.

**Calculation Logic:**  
The measure is defined using the following DAX formula:

```DAX
TotalHoursDeltaComplete =
    DIVIDE(
        [TotalActualHours],
        [TotalContractedHours],
        0
    )
```

This formula divides the total actual hours (`TotalActualHours`) by the total contracted hours (`TotalContractedHours`). If the denominator is zero, it returns 0 to avoid division errors.

**Format:**  
The result is formatted as a percentage with two decimal places, represented as `0.00%;-0.00%;0.00%`.

#### Measure: `TotalHoursDeltaCompleteNr`

### Measure: TotalHoursDeltaCompleteNr

**Purpose:**  
The `TotalHoursDeltaCompleteNr` measure calculates the difference between the total actual hours worked and the total contracted hours.

**Calculation Logic:**

```DAX
[TotalActualHours] - [TotalContractedHours]
```

This formula subtracts the total contracted hours from the total actual hours, providing a numerical representation of the difference between hours worked and hours contracted. 

**Format Hint:**  
The measure is formatted as a general number.

#### Measure: `TotalHoursTracked`

### Measure: TotalHoursTracked

**Purpose:**  
The `TotalHoursTracked` measure calculates the total hours tracked from the `vw_Timesheet` table. It ensures that if there are no hours recorded, the measure returns zero instead of a blank value.

**Calculation Logic:**  
The measure is defined as follows:

```DAX
IF (
    ISBLANK(SUM(vw_Timesheet[Hours])),
    0,
    SUM(vw_Timesheet[Hours])
)
```

This formula checks if the sum of hours is blank. If it is, the measure returns 0; otherwise, it returns the total sum of hours tracked. 

**Format Hint:**  
The measure is formatted as a general number.

#### Measure: `TotalHoursTrackedMissing`

### Measure: TotalHoursTrackedMissing

**Purpose:**  
The `TotalHoursTrackedMissing` measure is designed to evaluate the total hours tracked in the timesheet. It provides a way to identify whether the hours data is available or not.

```DAX
IF (
    ISBLANK(SUM(vw_Timesheet[Hours])),
    "Empty",
    SUM(vw_Timesheet[Hours])
)
```

This formula checks if the sum of hours from the `vw_Timesheet` table is blank. If it is blank, the measure returns the string "Empty"; otherwise, it returns the total sum of hours tracked. 

**Format Hint:**  
The measure is formatted as a general number.

#### Measure: `UTILIZATION_New`

### DAX Measure: UTILIZATION_New

**Purpose:**  
The `UTILIZATION_New` measure calculates the ratio of billable hours to total hours for active employees, providing insight into employee utilization rates.

**Calculation Logic:**  
The measure uses the following logic:
1. It retrieves the total billable hours from the `UTI_TotalBillableHours` measure.
2. It retrieves the total hours from the `UTI_TOTALHOURS` measure.
3. It checks if there are active contacts (`Msr_ActiveContacts`) and if total hours are not blank.
4. If the conditions are met, it calculates the ratio of total billable hours to total hours. If the division results in a blank, it returns 0.

**Formula:**
```DAX
VAR _TotalBillableHours = [UTI_TotalBillableHours]
VAR _TotalHours = [UTI_TOTALHOURS]

RETURN
    IF(NOT(ISBLANK([Msr_ActiveContacts])), 
        IF(NOT(ISBLANK([UTI_TOTALHOURS])), 
            IF(ISBLANK(DIVIDE(_TotalBillableHours, _TotalHours)), 0, DIVIDE(_TotalBillableHours, _TotalHours))
        )
    )
```

**Format:**  
0.00%;-0.00%;0.00%

#### Measure: `UTI_TOTALHOURS`

### Measure: UTI_TOTALHOURS

**Purpose:**  
The `UTI_TOTALHOURS` measure calculates the total hours worked by employees on projects that qualify for tracking.

**Calculation Logic:**

**Formula:**  
```DAX
UTI_TOTALHOURS = CALCULATE(SUM(vw_Timesheet[Hours]), vw_Timesheet[QualifyPrj] = 1)
```

**Format Hint:**  
The measure is formatted as a general number.

#### Measure: `UTI_TotalBillableHours`

### Measure: UTI_TotalBillableHours

**Purpose:**  
The `UTI_TotalBillableHours` measure calculates the total billable hours for projects that qualify as billable or are associated with "Customer Success Services."

**Calculation Logic:**  
The measure uses the following DAX formula:

```DAX
Var FilteredHours =
    Filter(
        vw_Timesheet,
        (
        vw_Timesheet[QualifyPrj] = 1 && 
        vw_Timesheet[BillablePrj] = 1) ||
            SEARCH("Customer Success Services", vw_Timesheet[Project], 1, 0) > 0
    )
RETURN 
    SUMX(FilteredHours, vw_Timesheet[Hours])
```

This formula filters the `vw_Timesheet` table to include only those entries where the project qualifies as billable or is related to "Customer Success Services," and then sums the hours for those filtered entries. 

**Format:**  
The result is formatted as a general number (0).

#### Measure: `UniqueEmployeesPerUnit`

### Measure: UniqueEmployeesPerUnit

**Purpose:**  
The `UniqueEmployeesPerUnit` measure calculates the number of unique employees per unit based on their incomplete status within a specified week.

**Calculation Logic:**  
The measure uses the `SUMX` function in conjunction with `SUMMARIZE` to group data from the `vw_missing_timesheet` table by week, employee name, and main unit. It retrieves the maximum value of the `IncompleteFlag` for each group, effectively counting the unique employees who have an incomplete status.

**Formula:**  
```DAX
SUMX(
    SUMMARIZE(
        vw_missing_timesheet,
        vw_missing_timesheet[Week_],
        vw_missing_timesheet[EmployeeName],
        vw_missing_timesheet[MAIN_UNIT],

    CALCULATE(
        MAXX(DISTINCT(vw_Timesheet[HoursPerWeek]), vw_Timesheet[HoursPerWeek]),
        ALLEXCEPT(vw_Timesheet, vw_Timesheet[EmployeeID])
    )
```

- It subtracts the maximum hours per week (considering distinct values) from the total hours tracked for each employee, while maintaining the context of the employee ID.

#### Measure: `trackedDiff2`

### Measure: trackedDiff2

**Purpose:**  
The `trackedDiff2` measure calculates the difference between the total hours tracked and the maximum hours per week for each employee, while removing filters on the `HoursPerWeek` column.

**Calculation Logic:**  
```DAX
[TotalHoursTracked] - 
    CALCULATE(
        MAXX(
            DISTINCT(vw_Timesheet[HoursPerWeek]), 
            vw_Timesheet[HoursPerWeek]
        ),
        REMOVEFILTERS(vw_Timesheet[HoursPerWeek]),
