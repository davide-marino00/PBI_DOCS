#### Measure: `Static Total Employees`

### Measure: 'Static Total Employees'

**Purpose:**  
The 'Static Total Employees' measure calculates the total number of distinct employees whose contract status is currently valid.

**Calculation Logic:**  
The measure uses the `CALCULATE` function to count distinct employee names from the `vw_Timesheet` table while applying the following filters:
- It removes all filters from the `vw_Timesheet` table using `ALL(vw_Timesheet)`.
- It includes only those records where the `ContractStatusToday` is "Valid".

**DAX Formula:**
```DAX
CALCULATE(
    DISTINCTCOUNT(vw_Timesheet[EmployeeName]), 
    ALL(vw_Timesheet),
    vw_Timesheet[ContractStatusToday] = "Valid"
)
```

**Format:**  
The measure is formatted as a general number (0).

    "Empty",
    SUM(vw_Timesheet[Hours])
)
```

This formula checks if the sum of hours from the `vw_Timesheet` table is blank. If it is blank, the measure returns the string "Empty"; otherwise, it returns the total sum of hours tracked. 

**Format Hint:**  
The measure is formatted as a general number.

#### Measure: `UTILIZATION_New`

### DAX Measure: UTILIZATION_New

**Purpose:**  
The `UTILIZATION_New` measure calculates the ratio of billable hours to total hours for active employees, providing insight into employee utilization rates.

**Calculation Logic:**  
The measure uses the following logic:
1. It retrieves the total billable hours from the `UTI_TotalBillableHours` measure.
2. It retrieves the total hours from the `UTI_TOTALHOURS` measure.
3. It checks if there are active contacts (employees) and if the total hours are not blank.
4. If the conditions are met, it calculates the ratio of total billable hours to total hours. If the division results in a blank, it returns 0.

**Formula:**
```DAX
VAR _TotalBillableHours = [UTI_TotalBillableHours]
VAR _TotalHours = [UTI_TOTALHOURS]

RETURN
    IF(NOT(ISBLANK([Msr_ActiveContacts])), 
        IF(NOT(ISBLANK([UTI_TOTALHOURS])), 
            IF(ISBLANK(DIVIDE(_TotalBillableHours, _TotalHours)), 0, DIVIDE(_TotalBillableHours, _TotalHours))
        )
    )
```

**Format:**  
0.00%;-0.00%;0.00%

#### Measure: `UTI_TOTALHOURS`

### Measure: UTI_TOTALHOURS

**Purpose:**  
The UTI_TOTALHOURS measure calculates the total hours worked by employees on projects that qualify for tracking.

**Calculation Logic:**  
The measure uses the `CALCULATE` function to sum the hours from the `vw_Timesheet` table, applying a filter to include only those records where the `QualifyPrj` column is equal to 1.

**Formula:**  
```DAX
UTI_TOTALHOURS = CALCULATE(SUM(vw_Timesheet[Hours]), vw_Timesheet[QualifyPrj] = 1)
```

**Format Hint:**  
The measure is formatted as a general number.

#### Measure: `UTI_TotalBillableHours`

### Measure: UTI_TotalBillableHours

**Purpose:**  
The `UTI_TotalBillableHours` measure calculates the total billable hours for projects that qualify as billable or are associated with "Customer Success Services."

**Calculation Logic:**  
The measure uses the following DAX formula:

```DAX
Var FilteredHours =
    Filter(
        vw_Timesheet,
        (
        vw_Timesheet[QualifyPrj] = 1 && 
        vw_Timesheet[BillablePrj] = 1) ||
            SEARCH("Customer Success Services", vw_Timesheet[Project], 1, 0) > 0
    )
RETURN 
    SUMX(FilteredHours, vw_Timesheet[Hours])
```

This formula filters the `vw_Timesheet` table to include only those entries where the project qualifies as billable or contains "Customer Success Services" in the project name, and then sums the hours for those filtered entries. 

**Format:**  
The result is formatted as a general number (0).

#### Measure: `UniqueEmployeesPerUnit`

### UniqueEmployeesPerUnit

**Purpose:**  
The `UniqueEmployeesPerUnit` measure calculates the number of unique employees associated with each unit, based on their incomplete status.

**Calculation Logic:**  
The measure uses the `SUMX` function to iterate over a summarized table created from `vw_missing_timesheet`. It groups the data by `Week_`, `EmployeeName`, and `MAIN_UNIT`, while also determining the maximum value of the `IncompleteFlag`. The final result is the sum of the `IncompleteFlag` values, which indicates the count of unique employees per unit.

**DAX Formula:**
```DAX
SUMX(
    SUMMARIZE(
        vw_missing_timesheet,
        vw_missing_timesheet[Week_],
        vw_missing_timesheet[EmployeeName],
        vw_missing_timesheet[MAIN_UNIT],
        "IncompleteFlag", MAX(vw_missing_timesheet[IncompleteFlag])
    ),
    [IncompleteFlag]
)
```

**Format:**  
The measure is formatted as a general number (0).

#### Measure: `trackedDiff`

### Measure: trackedDiff

**Purpose:**  
The `trackedDiff` measure calculates the difference between the total hours tracked and the maximum hours per week for each employee, providing insight into discrepancies in time tracking.

**Calculation Logic:**  
The measure is defined as follows:

```DAX
[TotalHoursTracked] - 
    CALCULATE(
        MAXX(DISTINCT(vw_Timesheet[HoursPerWeek]), vw_Timesheet[HoursPerWeek]),
        ALLEXCEPT(vw_Timesheet, vw_Timesheet[EmployeeID])
    )
```

- It subtracts the maximum hours per week (considering distinct values) from the total hours tracked for each employee, while maintaining the context of the employee ID.

#### Measure: `trackedDiff2`

### Measure: trackedDiff2

**Purpose:**  
The `trackedDiff2` measure calculates the difference between the total hours tracked and the maximum hours per week for each employee, while removing filters on the `HoursPerWeek` column.

**Calculation Logic:**  
The measure is defined as follows:

```DAX
[TotalHoursTracked] - 
    CALCULATE(
        MAXX(
            DISTINCT(vw_Timesheet[HoursPerWeek]), 
            vw_Timesheet[HoursPerWeek]
        ),
        REMOVEFILTERS(vw_Timesheet[HoursPerWeek]),
        ALLEXCEPT(vw_Timesheet, vw_Timesheet[EmployeeID])
    )
```

This formula computes the difference by taking the total hours tracked and subtracting the maximum distinct hours per week for the employee, ensuring that the calculation is not affected by filters on `HoursPerWeek` but retains the context of the specific employee.
