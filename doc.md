            vw_missing_timesheet[EmployeeName],
            vw_missing_timesheet[Year_],
            vw_missing_timesheet[Week_],
            lkp_Unit[Unit],
            vw_missing_timesheet[SubUnit],
            "MissingHours", SUM(vw_missing_timesheet[Hours_]) - MAX(vw_missing_timesheet[ContractHours]),
            "MinActiveEmp", MIN(vw_missing_timesheet[CC_ActiveEmployees])
        ),
        [MinActiveEmp] = 1 && [MissingHours] < 0
    )

RETURN 
    SUMX(ActiveEmployees, [MissingHours])
```

This measure first identifies active employees by filtering the summarized data from the `vw_missing_timesheet` table, where the minimum active employee count is 1 and the calculated missing hours are negative. It then sums the missing hours for these active employees. 

**Format:**

The measure is defined as follows:

```DAX
DIVIDE(
    SUM(vw_missing_timesheet[MissingHours]) - [ExpectedContractHoursWeekly],
    [ExpectedContractHoursWeekly],
    0
)
```

This formula computes the difference between the total missing hours and the expected contracted hours for the week, then divides that difference by the expected contracted hours. If the expected contracted hours are zero, it returns zero to avoid division by zero errors.

#### Measure: `Static Total Employees`

### Measure: 'Static Total Employees'

**Purpose:**  
The 'Static Total Employees' measure calculates the total number of distinct employees whose contract status is currently valid.

**Calculation Logic:**

IF (
    ISBLANK(SUM(vw_Timesheet[Hours])),
    "Empty",
    SUM(vw_Timesheet[Hours])
)
```

This formula checks if the sum of hours from the `vw_Timesheet` table is blank. If it is blank, the measure returns the string "Empty"; otherwise, it returns the total sum of hours tracked. 

**Format Hint:**  
The measure is formatted as a general number.

#### Measure: `UTILIZATION_New`

### DAX Measure: UTILIZATION_New

**Purpose:**  
The `UTILIZATION_New` measure calculates the ratio of billable hours to total hours for active employees, providing insight into employee utilization rates.

**Calculation Logic:**  
The measure uses the following logic:
1. It retrieves the total billable hours from the `UTI_TotalBillableHours` measure.
2. It retrieves the total hours from the `UTI_TOTALHOURS` measure.
3. It checks if there are active contacts (`Msr_ActiveContacts`) and if total hours are not blank.
4. If the conditions are met, it calculates the ratio of total billable hours to total hours. If the division results in a blank, it returns 0.

**Formula:**
```DAX
VAR _TotalBillableHours = [UTI_TotalBillableHours]
VAR _TotalHours = [UTI_TOTALHOURS]

RETURN
    IF(NOT(ISBLANK([Msr_ActiveContacts])), 
        IF(NOT(ISBLANK([UTI_TOTALHOURS])), 
            IF(ISBLANK(DIVIDE(_TotalBillableHours, _TotalHours)), 0, DIVIDE(_TotalBillableHours, _TotalHours))
        )
    )
```

**Format:**  
0.00%;-0.00%;0.00%

#### Measure: `UTI_TOTALHOURS`

### Measure: UTI_TOTALHOURS

**Purpose:**

**Formula:**  
```DAX
UTI_TOTALHOURS = CALCULATE(SUM(vw_Timesheet[Hours]), vw_Timesheet[QualifyPrj] = 1)
```

**Format Hint:**  
This measure is formatted as a general number.

#### Measure: `UTI_TotalBillableHours`

### Measure: UTI_TotalBillableHours

**Purpose:**  
The `UTI_TotalBillableHours` measure calculates the total billable hours for projects that qualify as billable or are associated with "Customer Success Services."

**Calculation Logic:**  
The measure uses the following DAX formula:

```DAX
Var FilteredHours =
    Filter(
        vw_Timesheet,
        (
        vw_Timesheet[QualifyPrj] = 1 && 
        vw_Timesheet[BillablePrj] = 1) ||
            SEARCH("Customer Success Services", vw_Timesheet[Project], 1, 0) > 0
    )
RETURN 
    SUMX(FilteredHours, vw_Timesheet[Hours])
```

This formula filters the `vw_Timesheet` table to include only those entries where the project qualifies as billable or is related to "Customer Success Services," and then sums the hours for those filtered entries. 

**Format:**  
The result is formatted as a general number (0).

#### Measure: `UniqueEmployeesPerUnit`

### UniqueEmployeesPerUnit

**Purpose:**  
The `UniqueEmployeesPerUnit` measure calculates the number of unique employees associated with each unit, based on their incomplete status.

**Calculation Logic:**  
The measure uses the `SUMX` function to iterate over a summarized table created from `vw_missing_timesheet`. This table is grouped by `Week_`, `EmployeeName`, and `MAIN_UNIT`, and includes a calculated column `IncompleteFlag` which captures the maximum value of `IncompleteFlag` for each grouping. The final result is the sum of the `IncompleteFlag` values, effectively counting unique employees per unit.

**DAX Formula:**
```DAX
SUMX(
    SUMMARIZE(
        vw_missing_timesheet,
        vw_missing_timesheet[Week_],
        vw_missing_timesheet[EmployeeName],
        vw_missing_timesheet[MAIN_UNIT],
        "IncompleteFlag", MAX(vw_missing_timesheet[IncompleteFlag])
    ),
    [IncompleteFlag]
)
```

**Format:**  
The measure is formatted as a general number (0).

#### Measure: `trackedDiff`

### Measure: trackedDiff

**Purpose:**

    CALCULATE(
        MAXX(DISTINCT(vw_Timesheet[HoursPerWeek]), vw_Timesheet[HoursPerWeek]),
        ALLEXCEPT(vw_Timesheet, vw_Timesheet[EmployeeID])
    )
```

- It subtracts the maximum hours per week (considering distinct values) from the total hours tracked for each employee, while maintaining the context of the employee ID.

#### Measure: `trackedDiff2`

### Measure: trackedDiff2

**Purpose:**  
The `trackedDiff2` measure calculates the difference between the total hours tracked and the maximum hours per week for each employee, while removing filters on the `HoursPerWeek` column.

**Calculation Logic:**  
The measure is defined as follows:

```DAX
[TotalHoursTracked] - 
    CALCULATE(
        MAXX(
            DISTINCT(vw_Timesheet[HoursPerWeek]), 
            vw_Timesheet[HoursPerWeek]
        ),
        REMOVEFILTERS(vw_Timesheet[HoursPerWeek]),
        ALLEXCEPT(vw_Timesheet, vw_Timesheet[EmployeeID])
    )
```

This formula computes the total hours tracked and subtracts the maximum hours per week for the employee, ensuring that the calculation is not affected by filters on `HoursPerWeek`, while still considering other filters related to `EmployeeID`.
