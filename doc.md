## 1. Overview

The Power BI solution presented is designed to analyze and visualize timesheet data, focusing on key performance metrics related to employee hours, sales amounts, and project management. The primary purpose of this solution appears to be to provide insights into resource allocation, project profitability, and overall operational efficiency within an organization. By leveraging a comprehensive data model that includes various tables such as `vw_Timesheet`, `tbl_Project`, and `DimDate`, the solution enables users to track and report on critical metrics like total hours worked, revenue generated, and project margins.

The data model is characterized by its complexity, incorporating multiple measures and calculated columns that facilitate in-depth analysis. Key tables include `vw_Timesheet`, which captures detailed timesheet entries, and `tbl_Project`, which contains project-related information. Important measures such as `MSR_ProjectMargin`, `MSR_Cumulative Sales`, and `MSR_%_Budget_Used` are defined to calculate profitability, cumulative sales over time, and budget utilization, respectively. The reports generated from this model focus on visualizing these metrics across different dimensions, such as time (using `DimDate`), project, and employee, allowing stakeholders to make informed decisions based on real-time data insights.

    vw_Timesheet[ReportReady] = FALSE()
)
```

**Format String:**  
0

#### Measure: `Dax_MissingHours`

### DAX Measure: Dax_MissingHours

**Purpose:**  
The `Dax_MissingHours` measure calculates the total missing hours for active employees who have reported negative missing hours in a given time frame.

**Calculation Logic:**  
The measure uses the following DAX formula:

```DAX
VAR ActiveEmployees = 
    FILTER(
        SUMMARIZE(
            vw_missing_timesheet,
            vw_missing_timesheet[EmployeeName],
            vw_missing_timesheet[Year_],
            vw_missing_timesheet[Week_],
            lkp_Unit[Unit],
            vw_missing_timesheet[SubUnit],
            "MissingHours", SUM(vw_missing_timesheet[Hours_]) - MAX(vw_missing_timesheet[ContractHours]),
            "MinActiveEmp", MIN(vw_missing_timesheet[CC_ActiveEmployees])
        ),
        [MinActiveEmp] = 1 && [MissingHours] < 0
    )

RETURN 
    SUMX(ActiveEmployees, [MissingHours])
```

This formula first creates a variable `ActiveEmployees` that filters a summarized table of `vw_missing_timesheet` for employees with at least one active status and negative missing hours. It then calculates the sum of missing hours for these active employees.

    FILTER(
        ALLSELECTED(DimDate[ShortDate]),
        DimDate[ShortDate] <= MAX(DimDate[ShortDate])
    )
)
```

This formula sums the `SalesAmount` from the `vw_Timesheet` table while filtering the dates to include only those that are less than or equal to the maximum date in the current context. The use of `ALLSELECTED` ensures that the calculation respects any filters applied in the report while still allowing for cumulative totals. 

**Format Hint:**  
The measure is annotated with a format hint indicating it is a general number.

#### Measure: `MSR_PROJECT_%_REALIZATION`

This formula computes the difference between the total missing hours and the expected contracted hours for the week, then divides that difference by the expected contracted hours. If the expected contracted hours are zero, it returns zero to avoid division by zero errors. 

**Format Hint:**  
The measure is annotated with `{"isGeneralNumber":true}`, indicating it is treated as a general number in Power BI.

#### Measure: `Static Total Employees`

### Measure: 'Static Total Employees'

**Purpose:**  
The 'Static Total Employees' measure calculates the total number of distinct employees whose contract status is currently valid.

**Calculation Logic:**  
The measure uses the following DAX formula:

```DAX
CALCULATE(
    DISTINCTCOUNT(vw_Timesheet[EmployeeName]), 
    ALL(vw_Timesheet),
    vw_Timesheet[ContractStatusToday] = "Valid"
)
```

This formula counts the distinct employee names in the `vw_Timesheet` table while ignoring any filters applied to the table, ensuring that only employees with a contract status of "Valid" are included in the count. 

**Format:**  
The measure is formatted as a general number (0).

#### Measure: `TotalActualHours`

### Measure: TotalActualHours

**Purpose:**  
The `TotalActualHours` measure calculates the total number of hours recorded in the `vw_Timesheet` table.

**Calculation Logic:**  
The measure is defined using the following DAX formula:

```DAX
SUM(vw_Timesheet[Hours])
```

This formula sums up all the values in the `Hours` column of the `vw_Timesheet` table.

**Format Hint:**  
The measure is formatted as a general number.

#### Measure: `TotalContractedHours`

### Measure: TotalContractedHours

**Purpose:**  
The `TotalContractedHours` measure calculates the total contracted hours for employees based on their maximum hours per week.

**Calculation Logic:**  
The measure uses the `SUMX` function to iterate over the distinct values of `EmployeeName` in the `vw_Timesheet` table, summing the maximum `HoursPerWeek` for each employee. The formula is as follows:

```DAX
SUMX(
    VALUES(vw_Timesheet[EmployeeName]),
    MAX(vw_Timesheet[HoursPerWeek])
)
```

**Format:**  
The result is formatted as a general number.

#### Measure: `TotalHoursDeltaComplete`

### Measure: TotalHoursDeltaComplete

**Purpose:**  
The `TotalHoursDeltaComplete` measure calculates the ratio of actual hours worked to the total contracted hours, providing insight into the completion status of hours relative to what was contracted.

**Calculation Logic:**  
The measure is defined using the following DAX formula:

```DAX
TotalHoursDeltaComplete =
    DIVIDE(
        [TotalActualHours],
        [TotalContractedHours],
        0
    )
```

- **[TotalActualHours]**: This measure sums the total hours recorded in the `vw_Timesheet` table.
- **[TotalContractedHours]**: This measure calculates the maximum contracted hours per employee.
- The `DIVIDE` function is used to safely perform the division, returning 0 if the denominator is zero.

**Format:**  
The result is formatted as a percentage with two decimal places.

#### Measure: `TotalHoursDeltaCompleteNr`

### Measure: TotalHoursDeltaCompleteNr

**Purpose:**  
The `TotalHoursDeltaCompleteNr` measure calculates the difference between the total actual hours worked and the total contracted hours.

**Calculation Logic:**  
The measure is defined as follows:

```DAX
[TotalActualHours] - [TotalContractedHours]
```

This formula subtracts the total contracted hours from the total actual hours, providing a numerical representation of the difference between hours worked and hours contracted. 

**Format Hint:**  
The measure is formatted as a general number.

#### Measure: `TotalHoursTracked`

### Measure: TotalHoursTracked

**Purpose:**  
The `TotalHoursTracked` measure calculates the total hours tracked from the `vw_Timesheet` table. It ensures that if there are no hours recorded, the result will default to zero.

**Calculation Logic:**  
The measure uses the following DAX formula:

```DAX
IF (
    ISBLANK(SUM(vw_Timesheet[Hours])),
    0,
    SUM(vw_Timesheet[Hours])
)
```

This formula checks if the sum of hours is blank. If it is, the measure returns 0; otherwise, it returns the total sum of hours tracked. 

**Format Hint:**  
The measure is formatted as a general number.

#### Measure: `TotalHoursTrackedMissing`

### Measure: TotalHoursTrackedMissing

**Purpose:**  
The `TotalHoursTrackedMissing` measure is designed to evaluate the total hours tracked in the timesheet, providing a clear indication of whether any hours have been recorded.

**Calculation Logic:**  
The measure uses the following DAX formula:

```DAX
IF (
    ISBLANK(SUM(vw_Timesheet[Hours])),
    "Empty",
    SUM(vw_Timesheet[Hours])
)
```

This formula checks if the sum of hours from the `vw_Timesheet` table is blank. If it is blank, the measure returns the string "Empty"; otherwise, it returns the total sum of hours tracked.

#### Measure: `UTILIZATION_New`

### DAX Measure: UTILIZATION_New

**Purpose:**  
The `UTILIZATION_New` measure calculates the ratio of billable hours to total hours for active employees, providing insight into the utilization of resources.

**Calculation Logic:**  
The measure uses the following logic:
1. It retrieves the total billable hours using the measure `[UTI_TotalBillableHours]`.
2. It retrieves the total hours using the measure `[UTI_TOTALHOURS]`.
3. It checks if the number of active contacts (`[Msr_ActiveContacts]`) is not blank.
4. If the total hours are not blank, it calculates the ratio of total billable hours to total hours. If this division results in a blank value, it returns 0.

**Formula:**
```DAX
VAR _TotalBillableHours = [UTI_TotalBillableHours]
VAR _TotalHours = [UTI_TOTALHOURS]

RETURN
    IF(NOT(ISBLANK([Msr_ActiveContacts])), 
        IF(NOT(ISBLANK([UTI_TOTALHOURS])), 
            IF(ISBLANK(DIVIDE(_TotalBillableHours, _TotalHours)), 0, DIVIDE(_TotalBillableHours, _TotalHours))
        )
    )
```

**Format:**  
0.00%;-0.00%;0.00%

#### Measure: `UTI_TOTALHOURS`

### Measure: UTI_TOTALHOURS

**Purpose:**  
The `UTI_TOTALHOURS` measure calculates the total hours worked by employees on projects that qualify for tracking.

**Calculation Logic:**  
The measure uses the `CALCULATE` function to sum the `Hours` from the `vw_Timesheet` table, applying a filter to include only those records where the `QualifyPrj` column is equal to 1.

**Formula:**  
```DAX
UTI_TOTALHOURS = CALCULATE(SUM(vw_Timesheet[Hours]), vw_Timesheet[QualifyPrj] = 1)
```

**Format Hint:**  
The measure is formatted as a general number.

#### Measure: `UTI_TotalBillableHours`

### Measure: UTI_TotalBillableHours

**Purpose:**  
The `UTI_TotalBillableHours` measure calculates the total billable hours from the `vw_Timesheet` table, specifically for projects that qualify as billable.

**Calculation Logic:**  
The measure filters the `vw_Timesheet` table to include only those entries where either:
- The `QualifyPrj` column is equal to 1 and the `BillablePrj` column is also equal to 1, or
- The `Project` column contains the phrase "Customer Success Services".

It then sums the `Hours` for the filtered entries.

**Formula:**
```DAX
Var FilteredHours =
    Filter(
        vw_Timesheet,
        (
        vw_Timesheet[QualifyPrj] = 1 && 
        vw_Timesheet[BillablePrj] = 1) ||
            SEARCH("Customer Success Services", vw_Timesheet[Project], 1, 0) > 0
    )
RETURN 
    SUMX(FilteredHours, vw_Timesheet[Hours])
```

**Format:**  
The measure is formatted as a general number (0).

#### Measure: `UniqueEmployeesPerUnit`

### Measure: UniqueEmployeesPerUnit

**Purpose:**  
The `UniqueEmployeesPerUnit` measure calculates the number of unique employees per unit based on their incomplete status within a specified week.

**Calculation Logic:**  
The measure uses the `SUMX` function in conjunction with `SUMMARIZE` to group data from the `vw_missing_timesheet` table by week, employee name, and main unit. It evaluates the maximum value of the `IncompleteFlag` for each group, effectively counting the unique employees who have an incomplete status.

**Formula:**  
```DAX
SUMX(
    SUMMARIZE(
        vw_missing_timesheet,
        vw_missing_timesheet[Week_],
        vw_missing_timesheet[EmployeeName],
        vw_missing_timesheet[MAIN_UNIT],
        "IncompleteFlag", MAX(vw_missing_timesheet[IncompleteFlag])
    ),
    [IncompleteFlag]
)
```

**Format:**  
The measure is formatted as a general number (0).

#### Measure: `trackedDiff`

### Measure: trackedDiff

**Purpose:**  
The `trackedDiff` measure calculates the difference between the total hours tracked and the maximum hours per week for each employee, providing insight into discrepancies in reported hours.

**Calculation Logic:**  
The measure is defined as follows:

```DAX
[TotalHoursTracked] - 
    CALCULATE(
        MAXX(DISTINCT(vw_Timesheet[HoursPerWeek]), vw_Timesheet[HoursPerWeek]),
        ALLEXCEPT(vw_Timesheet, vw_Timesheet[EmployeeID])
    )
```

- It subtracts the maximum hours per week (considering distinct values) from the total hours tracked for each employee, while maintaining the context of the employee ID.

#### Measure: `trackedDiff2`

### Measure: trackedDiff2

**Purpose:**  
The `trackedDiff2` measure calculates the difference between the total hours tracked and the maximum hours per week for each employee, while removing filters on the `HoursPerWeek` column.

**Calculation Logic:**  
The measure is defined as follows:

```DAX
[TotalHoursTracked] - 
    CALCULATE(
        MAXX(
            DISTINCT(vw_Timesheet[HoursPerWeek]), 
            vw_Timesheet[HoursPerWeek]
        ),
        REMOVEFILTERS(vw_Timesheet[HoursPerWeek]),
        ALLEXCEPT(vw_Timesheet, vw_Timesheet[EmployeeID])
    )
```

This formula computes the total hours tracked and subtracts the maximum distinct hours per week for the employee, ensuring that any filters on `HoursPerWeek` are removed while maintaining the context of the specific employee.
