### 2.2 Measures

#### Measure: `ContractStatus2`

### Measure: ContractStatus2

**Purpose:**
The `ContractStatus2` measure is designed to evaluate the status of a contract based on the calculated hours difference for active contracts. It provides insight into whether the contract is currently active and, if so, how many hours have been recorded against it.

**Calculation Logic:**
The measure uses an `IF` statement to determine the output based on the status of another measure, `ContractStatusMeasure`. The logic is as follows:

- If the `ContractStatusMeasure` indicates that the contract is "Active", the measure returns the value of `HoursDifference`.
- If the contract is not active, it returns the string "Not Active".

The formula for `ContractStatus2` is as follows:

```DAX
IF(
    [ContractStatusMeasure] = "Active",
    [HoursDifference],
    "Not Active"
)
```

**Output:**
- The output will be a numeric value representing the hours difference if the contract is active.
- If the contract is not active, the output will be the text "Not Active".

**Annotations:**
- The measure is annotated with `PBI_FormatHint = {"isGeneralNumber":true}`, indicating that the output is expected to be a general number format. 

This measure is useful for tracking the hours associated with active contracts and quickly identifying contracts that are no longer active.

#### Measure: `ContractStatusMeasure`

### Measure: ContractStatusMeasure

**Purpose:**
The `ContractStatusMeasure` is designed to determine the current status of a contract based on its end date. It categorizes contracts as either "Active" or "Not Active" depending on whether the contract is still valid as of today's date.

**Calculation Logic:**
The measure uses the following DAX formula:

```DAX
IF(
    ISBLANK(MAX('vw_Timesheet'[ContractEndDate])) || MAX('vw_Timesheet'[ContractEndDate]) > TODAY(),
    "Active",
    "Not Active"
)
```

**Explanation of the Formula:**
- The measure first checks if the maximum value of the `ContractEndDate` from the `vw_Timesheet` table is blank (i.e., there is no end date specified).
- If the `ContractEndDate` is blank or if it is greater than today's date (indicating that the contract is still ongoing), the measure returns "Active".
- If the `ContractEndDate` is not blank and is less than or equal to today's date, the measure returns "Not Active".

This measure is useful for tracking the status of contracts in a reporting environment, allowing users to quickly identify which contracts are currently active and which have expired.

#### Measure: `CountNegativeMissingHours`

### Measure: CountNegativeMissingHours

**Purpose:**
The `CountNegativeMissingHours` measure is designed to count the number of distinct employees who have recorded negative missing hours in the `vw_missing_timesheet` table. This measure is useful for identifying employees who may have discrepancies in their reported hours, indicating potential issues with timesheet submissions or data entry.

**Calculation Logic:**
The measure uses the `CALCULATE` function to modify the filter context and count distinct employee IDs from the `vw_missing_timesheet` table where the `MissingHours` column is less than zero. The DAX formula for this measure is as follows:

```DAX
CountNegativeMissingHours = 
CALCULATE(
    DISTINCTCOUNT('vw_missing_timesheet'[EmployeeID]),
    'vw_missing_timesheet'[MissingHours] < 0
)
```

**Format:**
The result of this measure is formatted as a whole number (0). 

This measure provides insights into the number of employees affected by negative missing hours, which can be critical for managing workforce reporting and ensuring accurate timesheet submissions.

#### Measure: `Count_Negative_Consultant`

### Measure: Count_Negative_Consultant

**Purpose:**

This measure helps in identifying consultants who may have discrepancies in their reported hours, which could indicate issues such as underreporting or data entry errors.

**Calculation Logic:**
The measure uses the `CALCULATE` function to modify the filter context and count distinct employee names where the `MissingHours` is less than zero. The DAX formula for this measure is as follows:

```DAX
Count_Negative_Consultant = 
CALCULATE(
    DISTINCTCOUNT('vw_missing_timesheet'[EmployeeName]),
    'vw_missing_timesheet'[MissingHours] < 0
)
```

- **DISTINCTCOUNT**: This function counts the number of unique values in the `EmployeeName` column of the `vw_missing_timesheet` table.
- **FILTER Condition**: The condition `'vw_missing_timesheet'[MissingHours] < 0` filters the data to include only those records where the `MissingHours` is negative.

**Purpose:**
The `CurrentWeekCard` measure is designed to return the current week number of the year based on the current date. This measure can be useful for reporting and analysis purposes, particularly in scenarios where tracking activities or performance on a weekly basis is essential.

**Calculation Logic:**
The measure is calculated using the DAX function `WEEKNUM`, which takes the current date (obtained using the `TODAY()` function) as its argument. The formula for the measure is as follows:

```DAX
CurrentWeekCard = WEEKNUM(TODAY())
```

This formula computes the week number of the year for the date returned by `TODAY()`, effectively providing the week number in which the current date falls.

**Format:**
The output of the `CurrentWeekCard` measure is formatted as a general number (integer), representing the week number. 

This measure can be utilized in dashboards and reports to provide context regarding the current week in relation to other time-based metrics or KPIs.

#### Measure: `DISTINCT_COUNT_EMP`

**Calculation Logic:**
The measure utilizes the following DAX formula:

```DAX
VAR ActiveEmployees = 
    FILTER(
        SUMMARIZE(
            vw_missing_timesheet,
            vw_missing_timesheet[EmployeeName],
            vw_missing_timesheet[Year_],
            vw_missing_timesheet[Week_],
            lkp_Unit[Unit],
            vw_missing_timesheet[SubUnit],
            "MissingHours", SUM(vw_missing_timesheet[Hours_]) - MAX(vw_missing_timesheet[ContractHours]),
            "MinActiveEmp", MIN(vw_missing_timesheet[CC_ActiveEmployees])
        ),
        [MinActiveEmp] = 1 && [MissingHours] < 0
    )

RETURN COUNTROWS(ActiveEmployees)
```

**Explanation of the Formula:**
1. **SUMMARIZE Function:** The measure first creates a summarized table from the `vw_missing_timesheet` view, grouping by employee name, year, week, unit, and subunit. It calculates two new columns:
   - `MissingHours`: This is computed as the total hours reported minus the maximum contracted hours for that employee.
   - `MinActiveEmp`: This captures the minimum count of active employees for the given grouping.

2. **FILTER Function:** The summarized table is then filtered to include only those records where:
   - `MinActiveEmp` equals 1 (indicating the employee is active).
   - `MissingHours` is less than 0 (indicating that the employee has reported fewer hours than contracted).

3. **COUNTROWS Function:** Finally, the measure returns the count of rows in the filtered table, which corresponds to the number of active employees with missing timesheet hours.

**Format:**

This measure is particularly useful for managers and team leads to monitor reporting compliance and take necessary actions to ensure timely report submissions.

#### Measure: `Dax_MissingHours`

### DAX Measure: Dax_MissingHours

**Purpose:**
The `Dax_MissingHours` measure is designed to calculate the total number of missing hours for active employees who have reported negative hours in a given time period. This measure helps in identifying discrepancies between the hours worked and the contracted hours, thereby assisting in workforce management and reporting.

**Calculation Logic:**
The measure operates as follows:

1. **Variable Definition (`ActiveEmployees`):**
   - It first creates a variable named `ActiveEmployees` that filters a summarized table derived from `vw_missing_timesheet`. This table includes the following columns:
     - `EmployeeName`
     - `Year_`
     - `Week_`
     - `Unit` (from `lkp_Unit`)
     - `SubUnit`
   - Two calculated columns are added to this summarized table:
     - `MissingHours`: This is calculated as the sum of hours reported (`SUM(vw_missing_timesheet[Hours_])`) minus the maximum contracted hours (`MAX(vw_missing_timesheet[ContractHours])`). This indicates how many hours are missing for each employee.
     - `MinActiveEmp`: This is the minimum value of active employees (`MIN(vw_missing_timesheet[CC_ActiveEmployees])`).

2. **Filtering Criteria:**
   - The `FILTER` function is applied to the summarized table to retain only those records where:
     - `MinActiveEmp` equals 1 (indicating the employee is active).
     - `MissingHours` is less than 0 (indicating that the employee has reported fewer hours than contracted).

3. **Final Calculation:**
   - The measure then returns the sum of `MissingHours` for the filtered `ActiveEmployees` using the `SUMX` function, which iterates over the filtered table and sums the `MissingHours` for each active employee.

**Formula:**
```DAX
VAR ActiveEmployees = 
    FILTER(
        SUMMARIZE(
            vw_missing_timesheet,
            vw_missing_timesheet[EmployeeName],

            vw_missing_timesheet[Week_],
            lkp_Unit[Unit],
            vw_missing_timesheet[SubUnit],
            "MissingHours", SUM(vw_missing_timesheet[Hours_]) - MAX(vw_missing_timesheet[ContractHours]),
            "MinActiveEmp", MIN(vw_missing_timesheet[CC_ActiveEmployees])
        ),
        [MinActiveEmp] = 1 && [MissingHours] < 0
    )
RETURN 
    SUMX(ActiveEmployees, [MissingHours])
```

**Format:**
The measure is formatted as a general number, allowing for straightforward numerical representation of the total missing hours.

This measure is crucial for organizations to monitor and manage employee hours effectively, ensuring compliance with contracted hours and identifying potential issues in time reporting.

#### Measure: `ExpectedContractHoursWeekly`

### Measure: ExpectedContractHoursWeekly

**Purpose:**
The `ExpectedContractHoursWeekly` measure calculates the total expected contract hours for each employee on a weekly basis. This measure is useful for tracking whether employees are meeting their contracted hours and for identifying any discrepancies in hours worked versus hours expected.

**Calculation Logic:**
The measure is defined using the following DAX formula:

```DAX
SUMX(
    SUMMARIZE(
        vw_missing_timesheet,
        vw_missing_timesheet[Week_],
        vw_missing_timesheet[EmployeeID],
        "ContractHours", MAX(vw_missing_timesheet[ContractHours])
    ),
    [ContractHours]
)
```

**Explanation of the Formula:**
1. **SUMMARIZE Function:** This function creates a summary table that groups the data by `Week_` and `EmployeeID`. For each group, it calculates the maximum `ContractHours` for that employee in that week.
2. **MAX Function:** The `MAX` function is used to ensure that if there are multiple entries for an employee in a week, only the highest contract hours are considered.
3. **SUMX Function:** Finally, the `SUMX` function iterates over the summarized table and sums up the `ContractHours` for all employees across the weeks.

**Output:**
The output of this measure is a numeric value representing the total expected contract hours for all employees for the current week, formatted as a general number. 

This measure is particularly useful for performance tracking and resource management within an organization, allowing managers to assess whether employees are fulfilling their contractual obligations in terms of hours worked.

#### Measure: `HoursDifference`

### Measure: HoursDifference

**Purpose:**
The `HoursDifference` measure calculates the difference between the total hours recorded in the `vw_Timesheet` table and the maximum contracted hours per week for employees. This measure is useful for assessing whether employees are working more or fewer hours than their contracted amount, which can help in resource management and workload balancing.

**Calculation Logic:**
The measure is defined using the following DAX formula:

```DAX
HoursDifference = SUM('vw_Timesheet'[Hours]) - MAX('vw_Timesheet'[HoursperWeek])
```

- **SUM('vw_Timesheet'[Hours])**: This part of the formula sums up all the hours recorded in the `Hours` column of the `vw_Timesheet` table.
- **MAX('vw_Timesheet'[HoursperWeek])**: This retrieves the maximum value from the `HoursperWeek` column, which represents the contracted hours for the week for employees.
- The measure then subtracts the maximum contracted hours from the total hours worked to yield the difference.

**Format:**
The measure is formatted as a general number, allowing for a straightforward numerical representation of the hours difference.

**Use Cases:**
- To identify employees who are exceeding their contracted hours.
- To monitor workload and ensure that employees are not overworked or underutilized.
- To provide insights for management regarding staffing and resource allocation.

#### Measure: `MISSING%`

### Measure: MISSING%

#### Purpose
The `MISSING%` measure calculates the percentage of employees who are missing timesheet entries compared to the total number of distinct employees. This measure helps in assessing the completeness of timesheet submissions within a given dataset.

#### Calculation Logic
The formula for the `MISSING%` measure is as follows:

```DAX
MISSING% = DIVIDE([Dax_EmpCount] - [Dax_EmpCount_MissingTS], [Dax_EmpCount]) * 100
```

- **[Dax_EmpCount]**: This measure counts the total number of distinct employees in the dataset.
- **[Dax_EmpCount_MissingTS]**: This measure counts the number of distinct employees who have missing timesheet entries, specifically those who have negative missing hours and are considered active.
- The difference between these two measures (`[Dax_EmpCount] - [Dax_EmpCount_MissingTS]`) gives the count of employees who have submitted their timesheets correctly.
- The result is then divided by the total employee count (`[Dax_EmpCount]`) to get the proportion of employees with complete timesheet submissions.
- Finally, the result is multiplied by 100 to convert it into a percentage format.

#### Format
The measure is formatted as a general number, allowing for easy interpretation of the percentage value.

This measure is useful for monitoring compliance with timesheet submission policies and identifying areas where additional training or reminders may be necessary to improve submission rates.

#### Measure: `MSR_%_Budget_Used`

### Measure: MSR_%_Budget_Used

**Purpose:**
The `MSR_%_Budget_Used` measure calculates the percentage of the budget that has been utilized based on the total sales amount recorded in the timesheet compared to the total budget allocated for the project. This measure is useful for assessing how much of the budget has been consumed, allowing for better financial management and project tracking.

**Calculation Logic:**
The measure is defined using the following DAX formula:

```DAX
DIVIDE(SUM(vw_Timesheet[SalesAmount]), SUM('tbl_Project'[SalesPriceBaseCurrency]), 0)
```

- **SUM(vw_Timesheet[SalesAmount])**: This part of the formula sums up the total sales amount recorded in the `vw_Timesheet` table.
- **SUM('tbl_Project'[SalesPriceBaseCurrency])**: This part sums up the total budget allocated for the project from the `tbl_Project` table.
- **DIVIDE(..., 0)**: The `DIVIDE` function is used to safely perform the division, returning 0 if the denominator (total budget) is zero, thus preventing division by zero errors.

**Format:**
The result of this measure is formatted as a percentage with two decimal places, allowing for easy interpretation of the budget utilization. The format string is defined as `0.00%;-0.00%;0.00%`, which means:
- Positive values are displayed with two decimal places.
- Negative values are displayed with a negative sign and two decimal places.
- Zero values are displayed as `0.00%`.

This measure provides valuable insights into budget management and helps stakeholders understand the financial status of projects in relation to their budgets.

Overall, `UTI_TOTALHOURS` serves as a critical metric for understanding employee engagement in projects that meet specific qualification criteria.

#### Measure: `UTI_TotalBillableHours`

### Measure: UTI_TotalBillableHours

**Purpose:**
The `UTI_TotalBillableHours` measure calculates the total number of billable hours recorded in the `vw_Timesheet` table. This measure is essential for assessing the productivity and utilization of resources on billable projects.

**Calculation Logic:**
The measure uses a variable `FilteredHours` to filter the `vw_Timesheet` table based on specific criteria. It includes only those records where either:
- The `QualifyPrj` column is equal to 1 and the `BillablePrj` column is also equal to 1, or
- The `Project` column contains the phrase "Customer Success Services".

Once the relevant records are filtered, the measure sums the `Hours` column for these filtered records using the `SUMX` function.

**DAX Formula:**
```DAX
Var FilteredHours =
    Filter(
        vw_Timesheet,
        (
        vw_Timesheet[QualifyPrj] = 1 && 
        vw_Timesheet[BillablePrj] = 1) ||
            SEARCH("Customer Success Services", vw_Timesheet[Project], 1, 0) > 0
    )
RETURN 
    SUMX(FilteredHours, vw_Timesheet[Hours])
```

**Format:**
The result of this measure is formatted as a general number (integer), which is suitable for representing total hours.

This measure is crucial for financial analysis and project management, allowing stakeholders to track billable hours effectively and make informed decisions based on resource utilization.

#### Measure: `UniqueEmployeesPerUnit`

### Measure: UniqueEmployeesPerUnit

**Description:**
The `UniqueEmployeesPerUnit` measure calculates the number of unique employees associated with each unit, based on their weekly records in the `vw_missing_timesheet` table. This measure is particularly useful for analyzing employee distribution across different units and identifying any discrepancies in employee activity.

**Purpose:**
The primary purpose of this measure is to provide insights into the number of distinct employees per unit, which can help in workforce management and resource allocation.

**Calculation Logic:**
The measure uses the `SUMX` function in conjunction with `SUMMARIZE` to aggregate data from the `vw_missing_timesheet` table. The calculation is performed as follows:

1. **SUMMARIZE**: The measure groups the data by `Week_`, `EmployeeName`, and `MAIN_UNIT`, while also capturing the maximum value of the `IncompleteFlag` for each group. This flag indicates whether there are any incomplete records for the employee in that week.

2. **SUMX**: The outer function iterates over the summarized table and sums the values of the `IncompleteFlag`. This effectively counts the unique employees who have records in the specified week and unit.

**Formula:**
```DAX
UniqueEmployeesPerUnit = 
SUMX(
    SUMMARIZE(
        vw_missing_timesheet,
        vw_missing_timesheet[Week_],
        vw_missing_timesheet[EmployeeName],
        vw_missing_timesheet[MAIN_UNIT],
        "IncompleteFlag", MAX(vw_missing_timesheet[IncompleteFlag])
    ),
    [IncompleteFlag]
)
```

**Format:**
The result of this measure is formatted as a general number (0), which means it will display as a whole number without decimal places.

This measure is essential for understanding employee engagement and ensuring that all units are adequately staffed and monitored for timesheet compliance.

#### Measure: `trackedDiff`

### Measure: `trackedDiff`

**Purpose:**
The `trackedDiff` measure calculates the difference between the total hours tracked for an employee and the maximum hours recorded per week for that employee, excluding any filters on the `HoursPerWeek` column. This measure is useful for assessing discrepancies between the hours an employee has logged and their maximum allowable hours in a given week.

**Calculation Logic:**
The measure is defined as follows:

```DAX
trackedDiff = 
    [TotalHoursTracked] - 
        CALCULATE(
            MAXX(DISTINCT(vw_Timesheet[HoursPerWeek]), vw_Timesheet[HoursPerWeek]),
            ALLEXCEPT(vw_Timesheet, vw_Timesheet[EmployeeID])
        )
```

- **`[TotalHoursTracked]`**: This part of the formula retrieves the total hours tracked for the employee. If there are no hours logged, it defaults to zero.
  
- **`CALCULATE(...)`**: This function modifies the context in which the data is evaluated. It computes the maximum hours per week for the employee by:
  - Using `MAXX` to find the maximum value of `HoursPerWeek` from a distinct list of weekly hours.
  - Applying `ALLEXCEPT` to remove any filters on the `vw_Timesheet` table except for the `EmployeeID`, ensuring that the calculation is specific to the individual employee.

The result of the `trackedDiff` measure indicates whether the total hours tracked exceed the maximum hours allowed in a week, providing insights into employee workload and potential overages. 

**Format Hint:**
The measure is formatted as a general number, allowing for flexibility in displaying the results.

#### Measure: `trackedDiff2`

### Measure: `trackedDiff2`

**Purpose:**
The `trackedDiff2` measure calculates the difference between the total hours tracked for an employee and the maximum hours per week recorded in the timesheet, while removing filters on the `HoursPerWeek` column and retaining context for each employee. This measure is useful for assessing discrepancies in hours reported versus expected hours based on weekly limits.

**Calculation Logic:**
The measure is defined as follows:

```DAX
trackedDiff2 = 
    [TotalHoursTracked] - 
        CALCULATE(
            MAXX(
                DISTINCT(vw_Timesheet[HoursPerWeek]), 
                vw_Timesheet[HoursPerWeek]
            ),
            REMOVEFILTERS(vw_Timesheet[HoursPerWeek]),
            ALLEXCEPT(vw_Timesheet, vw_Timesheet[EmployeeID])
        )
```

1. **Total Hours Tracked**: The measure begins by referencing the `TotalHoursTracked` measure, which sums the hours recorded in the `vw_Timesheet` table, returning 0 if the sum is blank.

2. **Maximum Hours Per Week**: It then calculates the maximum hours per week using the `MAXX` function over a distinct list of `HoursPerWeek` from the `vw_Timesheet`. This ensures that only unique weekly hour values are considered.

3. **Context Management**: The `CALCULATE` function modifies the filter context:
   - `REMOVEFILTERS(vw_Timesheet[HoursPerWeek])` removes any filters applied to the `HoursPerWeek` column, allowing for a complete view of the data.
   - `ALLEXCEPT(vw_Timesheet, vw_Timesheet[EmployeeID])` retains the context for each employee, ensuring that the calculation is specific to the individual employee's data.

**Output:**
The result of `trackedDiff2` is a numeric value representing the difference between the total hours tracked and the maximum allowable hours per week for each employee, providing insights into potential over-reporting or under-reporting of hours worked. 

**Format Hint:**
The measure is annotated with `{"isGeneralNumber":true}`, indicating that it is formatted as a general number.
