##### Calculated Columns

**`Blank`** (`string`)

- **Description:** The 'Blank' column in the Opportunities table is intended to hold placeholder or unused string values for future data enrichment or processing needs.
- **DAX Expression:**
```dax
BLANK()
```
- **DAX Explanation (Generated):** The DAX expression `BLANK()` is used to create a calculated column that contains no value, essentially representing an empty or null state. 

In simple business terms, when you use `BLANK()` in a calculated column, you are telling the system to leave that column empty for every row in the table. This can be useful in various scenarios, such as:

1. **Placeholder for Future Data**: You might want to reserve a column for future data that isn't available yet, and using `BLANK()` indicates that the data is intentionally left out for now.

2. **Conditional Logic**: If you plan to use this column in further calculations or visualizations, having a `BLANK()` value can help you differentiate between rows that have no data versus those that have actual values.

3. **Data Cleaning**: It can also be used to clear out values in a column when certain conditions are met, effectively marking those rows as having no relevant data.

Overall, `BLANK()` is a way to explicitly define that a column should not contain any value, which can help maintain clarity and organization in your data model.

**`Days Remaining In Pipeline`** (`string`)

- **Description:** The 'Days Remaining In Pipeline' column indicates the number of days left for an opportunity to progress through the sales pipeline, helping stakeholders assess urgency and prioritize follow-ups.
- **DAX Expression:**
```dax
IF(Opportunities[Status]="Open", DATEDIFF(TODAY(),Opportunities[CloseDate],DAY),0)
```
- **DAX Explanation (Generated):** This DAX code snippet is used to create a calculated column called "Days Remaining In Pipeline" for a dataset of opportunities. Here's a breakdown of what it does in simple business terms:

1. **Condition Check**: The expression starts by checking if the status of an opportunity is "Open". This means it only considers opportunities that are still active and have not been closed yet.

2. **Calculate Days Remaining**: If the opportunity is "Open", it calculates the number of days remaining until the opportunity's close date. It does this by using the `DATEDIFF` function, which finds the difference between today's date (`TODAY()`) and the opportunity's close date (`Opportunities[CloseDate]`). The result is expressed in days.

3. **Return Value**: If the opportunity is not "Open" (meaning it is either closed or in another status), the expression returns 0. This indicates that there are no days remaining in the pipeline for opportunities that are not active.

### Summary:
In summary, this DAX expression calculates how many days are left until an opportunity is expected to close, but only for those opportunities that are currently open. If the opportunity is closed or in another status, it simply shows 0 days remaining. This helps businesses track how much time is left to potentially close active deals.

**`Days Remaining In Pipeline (bins)`** (`string`)

- **Description:** Column Description: This column categorizes the remaining days in the sales pipeline into predefined bins, facilitating quick assessment of opportunity urgency and prioritization for sales teams.

**`Weeks Open`** (`string`)

- **Description:** The 'Weeks Open' column indicates the duration, in weeks, that each opportunity has been active since its creation, represented as a string for flexible formatting.

##### Measures

**`Close %`**

- **DAX Expression:**
```dax
[Count of Won]/([Count of Won]+[Count of Lost])
```
- **DAX Explanation (Generated):** The DAX expression you provided calculates the "Close %" measure, which represents the percentage of successful outcomes (or "won" deals) compared to the total number of outcomes (both "won" and "lost" deals).

Here's a breakdown of the components:

1. **[Count of Won]**: This part counts the number of deals or opportunities that were successfully closed (won).

2. **[Count of Lost]**: This part counts the number of deals or opportunities that were not successful (lost).

3. **([Count of Won] + [Count of Lost])**: This adds together the number of won and lost deals to get the total number of deals that were either won or lost.

4. **[Count of Won] / ([Count of Won] + [Count of Lost])**: Finally, this divides the number of won deals by the total number of deals (won + lost). 

### What It Achieves:
The result of this calculation is a decimal value that represents the proportion of deals that were won out of all deals. To express it as a percentage, you would typically multiply the result by 100. 

In simple terms, this measure tells you how successful your sales efforts are by showing the percentage of deals that were successfully closed compared to all deals pursued. A higher percentage indicates better performance in closing deals.

**`Count of Lost`**

- **DAX Expression:**
```dax
COUNTAX(
			    FILTER(
			        KEEPFILTERS(Opportunities),Opportunities[Status] = "Lost"
			        ),
			    Opportunities[OpportunitySeq]
			    )
```
- **DAX Explanation (Generated):** This DAX code snippet is designed to calculate the number of opportunities that have a status of "Lost" within a dataset called `Opportunities`. Let's break it down step by step in simple business terms:

1. **COUNTAX Function**: This function counts the number of rows that meet certain criteria. In this case, it will count the opportunities that are filtered based on their status.

2. **FILTER Function**: This part of the code is used to create a subset of the `Opportunities` table. It filters the table to include only those rows where the `Status` column equals "Lost". Essentially, it narrows down the data to just the opportunities that have been marked as lost.

3. **KEEPIFILTERS Function**: This function ensures that any existing filters applied to the `Opportunities` table remain in effect while applying the new filter for lost opportunities. This means that if there are other filters (like date ranges or specific sales regions) already applied, they will still be considered in the calculation.

4. **Opportunities[OpportunitySeq]**: This is the column that the COUNTAX function will count. It represents a unique identifier for each opportunity. By counting this column, the measure effectively counts how many opportunities have been marked as "Lost".

### Summary:
In summary, this DAX measure calculates the total number of opportunities that have been classified as "Lost", while respecting any other filters that might be applied to the data. This is useful for businesses to understand how many potential sales were not successful, which can inform strategies for improvement and analysis of lost opportunities.

**`Count of Won`**

- **DAX Expression:**
```dax
COUNTAX(
			    FILTER(
			        KEEPFILTERS(Opportunities),Opportunities[Status] = "Won"
			        ),
			    Opportunities[OpportunitySeq]
			    )
```
- **DAX Explanation (Generated):** This DAX code snippet is designed to create a measure called 'Count of Won' that counts the number of opportunities that have been marked as "Won" in a dataset of sales opportunities. Here’s a breakdown of what each part does in simple business terms:

1. **COUNTAX**: This function is used to count the number of rows that meet certain criteria. In this case, it will count the opportunities that have been filtered based on their status.

2. **FILTER**: This function is applied to the Opportunities table to narrow down the data. It looks at each opportunity and checks if its status is "Won". Only those opportunities that meet this condition will be included in the next step.

3. **KEEPIFILTERS**: This function ensures that any existing filters applied to the Opportunities table (like filters from slicers or other visuals in a report) are preserved while adding the new filter for the status. This means that the count will respect any other selections made by the user.

4. **Opportunities[OpportunitySeq]**: This is the column that the COUNTAX function will count. It represents a unique identifier for each opportunity. By counting this column, the measure effectively counts how many opportunities have the status "Won".

### In Summary:
The 'Count of Won' measure calculates the total number of sales opportunities that have been successfully won, while also considering any other filters that may be applied in the report. This helps businesses understand their success rate in closing deals and can be used for performance analysis and reporting.

**`Forecast`**

- **DAX Expression:**
```dax
([Revenue Won]+[Revenue In Pipeline])
```
- **DAX Explanation (Generated):** This DAX expression calculates the total expected revenue by adding two key components together:

1. **Revenue Won**: This represents the revenue that has already been secured or confirmed from sales that have been completed. It reflects the money that the business has successfully earned from customers.

2. **Revenue In Pipeline**: This refers to the potential revenue from sales that are currently in progress but have not yet been finalized. This includes deals that are being negotiated or are expected to close in the near future.

By summing these two values, the expression provides a forecast of total revenue, combining both what has been achieved and what is anticipated. This helps businesses understand their current financial health and future revenue potential, allowing for better planning and decision-making.

**`Forecast %`**

- **DAX Expression:**
```dax
(([Revenue Won]+[Revenue In Pipeline]))/ [Rev Goal]
```
- **DAX Explanation (Generated):** This DAX code snippet calculates a measure called 'Forecast %', which represents the percentage of revenue that is expected to be achieved compared to a predefined revenue goal. Here’s a breakdown of what each part of the expression does:

1. **Revenue Won**: This is the total revenue that has already been successfully secured or closed. It represents the sales that have been finalized.

2. **Revenue In Pipeline**: This refers to the potential revenue that is currently in the sales pipeline. This includes deals that are in progress but have not yet been finalized. It represents future sales that are expected to close.

3. **Rev Goal**: This is the revenue goal or target that the business aims to achieve within a specific period.

4. **Calculation**: The expression adds together the 'Revenue Won' and 'Revenue In Pipeline' to get the total expected revenue. Then, it divides this total by the 'Rev Goal' to determine what percentage of the goal has been achieved or is expected to be achieved.

In simple terms, this measure shows how much of the revenue target has been met or is anticipated to be met based on current sales and potential sales. A higher percentage indicates that the business is on track to meet or exceed its revenue goal, while a lower percentage suggests that there may be a shortfall.

**`Forecast by Win/Loss Ratio`**

- **DAX Expression:**
```dax
[Revenue Open] * [Close %]
```
- **DAX Explanation (Generated):** The DAX expression you've provided is a simple calculation that combines two key metrics to derive a forecasted value. Let's break it down:

1. **[Revenue Open]**: This represents the total revenue that is currently open or in the pipeline. It could be the revenue from potential sales that have not yet been finalized or closed.

2. **[Close %]**: This is the percentage likelihood that the open revenue will actually be closed or converted into actual sales. It reflects the probability of successfully completing those sales.

### What the Expression Achieves:

The expression `[Revenue Open] * [Close %]` calculates the **forecasted revenue** based on the current open opportunities and the likelihood of closing those opportunities. 

- **Forecasted Revenue**: By multiplying the total open revenue by the close percentage, the measure estimates how much of the open revenue is expected to be realized as actual revenue. 

### In Business Terms:

This calculation helps businesses understand how much revenue they can realistically expect to earn from their current sales opportunities. It provides a more accurate picture of future revenue by considering not just the total potential sales, but also the likelihood of those sales being completed. This is crucial for financial planning, resource allocation, and setting realistic sales targets.

**`Opportunity Count`**

- **DAX Explanation (Generated):** (No DAX expression found)

**`Opportunity Count In Pipeline`**

- **DAX Expression:**
```dax
CALCULATE (
			        COUNT( Opportunities[Value] ),
			        FILTER (
			            Opportunities,
			            Opportunities[Status] = "Open"
			        )
			    )
```
- **DAX Explanation (Generated):** This DAX code snippet is designed to create a measure called "Opportunity Count In Pipeline." Let's break it down in simple business terms:

1. **Purpose**: The measure counts the number of opportunities that are currently in the pipeline, specifically those that are "Open."

2. **Components**:
   - **CALCULATE**: This function changes the context in which data is evaluated. In this case, it is used to modify the counting of opportunities based on specific criteria.
   - **COUNT(Opportunities[Value])**: This part counts the number of entries in the "Value" column of the "Opportunities" table. Essentially, it counts how many opportunities there are.
   - **FILTER(Opportunities, Opportunities[Status] = "Open")**: This part filters the "Opportunities" table to include only those rows where the "Status" is "Open." This means that only opportunities that are currently active and not closed or lost will be considered in the count.

3. **What it Achieves**: The overall result of this measure is a count of all the active opportunities in the pipeline. It helps businesses understand how many potential deals are currently being pursued, providing insight into sales activity and potential revenue.

In summary, this DAX measure effectively counts and reports the number of open opportunities, helping organizations track their sales pipeline and manage their sales efforts more effectively.

**`Revenue In Pipeline`**

- **DAX Expression:**
```dax
VAR Revenue =
			    CALCULATE (
			        SUMX ( Opportunities, Opportunities[Value] ),
			        FILTER (
			            Opportunities,
			            Opportunities[Status] = "Open"
			            && VALUE(LEFT(Opportunities[Sales Stage],1)) >=2
			        )
			    )
			RETURN
			    Revenue + ( Revenue * ( 'Opportunity Forecast Adjustment'[Forecast Adjustment Value] / 100 ) )
```
- **DAX Explanation (Generated):** This DAX code snippet calculates a measure called "Revenue In Pipeline," which represents the expected revenue from sales opportunities that are currently open and at a certain stage in the sales process. Here's a breakdown of what it does in simple business terms:

1. **Identify Open Opportunities**: The code first looks at a table called `Opportunities` to find all sales opportunities that are currently "Open." This means these are potential sales that have not yet been closed.

2. **Filter by Sales Stage**: It further narrows down these open opportunities by checking their "Sales Stage." Specifically, it only includes opportunities where the sales stage is at least 2 or higher. This implies that the opportunity is more advanced in the sales process and has a higher likelihood of closing successfully.

3. **Calculate Total Value**: For all the filtered opportunities, the code sums up their values (the potential revenue from each opportunity). This total is stored in a variable called `Revenue`.

4. **Adjust for Forecasting**: After calculating the total revenue from the open opportunities, the code applies a forecast adjustment. This adjustment is based on a percentage value found in another table called `Opportunity Forecast Adjustment`. The adjustment is calculated by taking the total revenue and increasing it by a percentage (the adjustment value divided by 100).

5. **Final Result**: The final output of this measure is the total revenue from the open opportunities, plus any additional revenue from the forecast adjustment. This gives a more accurate picture of the expected revenue in the pipeline, taking into account both the current opportunities and any adjustments based on forecasting.

In summary, this DAX measure helps businesses understand how much revenue they can expect from their current sales opportunities, factoring in their likelihood of closing and any adjustments based on forecasting.

**`Revenue Open`**

- **DAX Explanation (Generated):** (No DAX expression found)

**`Revenue Won`**

- **DAX Expression:**
```dax
CALCULATE(
			     SUMX(Opportunities, Opportunities[Value]),
			     FILTER(Opportunities, Opportunities[Status] = "Won")
			 )
```
- **DAX Explanation (Generated):** This DAX code snippet is designed to calculate the total revenue from opportunities that have been marked as "Won." Let's break it down step by step:

1. **CALCULATE Function**: This function changes the context in which data is evaluated. In this case, it is used to modify the calculation of the total revenue based on specific criteria.

2. **SUMX Function**: This function iterates over a table (in this case, the `Opportunities` table) and sums up a specific column (the `Value` column). It calculates the total value of each opportunity.

3. **Opportunities Table**: This is the data source that contains information about various sales opportunities, including their values and statuses.

4. **FILTER Function**: This function is used to create a subset of the `Opportunities` table. It filters the table to include only those opportunities where the `Status` is "Won."

Putting it all together, this DAX expression does the following:

- It looks at the `Opportunities` table and filters it to include only those opportunities that have been won (i.e., their status is "Won").
- Then, for these filtered opportunities, it sums up the values in the `Value` column.
- The result is the total revenue generated from all the opportunities that have been successfully won.

In simple terms, this measure calculates the total revenue from all sales opportunities that have been successfully closed as won.

**`Revenue Won Average Deal Size`**

- **DAX Expression:**
```dax
AVERAGEX(Opportunities,[Revenue Won])
```
- **DAX Explanation (Generated):** The DAX expression you provided calculates the average deal size for opportunities that have been won. Here's a breakdown of what it does in simple business terms:

1. **Context**: The measure is likely used in a report or dashboard that tracks sales opportunities. Each opportunity represents a potential sale, and "Revenue Won" refers to the amount of money generated from those sales that were successfully closed.

2. **AVERAGEX Function**: The `AVERAGEX` function is a DAX function that calculates the average of a set of values. It takes two arguments: a table (or a set of rows) and an expression that defines what value to average.

3. **Opportunities Table**: In this case, the first argument is the `Opportunities` table. This table contains all the sales opportunities, including both won and lost deals.

4. **[Revenue Won]**: The second argument, `[Revenue Won]`, is a measure or column that represents the revenue generated from each won opportunity. This means that for each opportunity in the `Opportunities` table, the function looks at the revenue that was actually won.

5. **Calculation**: The `AVERAGEX` function goes through each opportunity in the `Opportunities` table, retrieves the revenue for those that were won, and then calculates the average of those revenue amounts.

### Summary:
In summary, this DAX expression calculates the average revenue from all the sales opportunities that have been successfully closed (won). This measure helps businesses understand the typical deal size they achieve when they win sales, which can be useful for forecasting, budgeting, and evaluating sales performance.

#### <a name="table-opportunity-forecast-adjustment"></a>Table: `Opportunity Forecast Adjustment`

The 'Opportunity Forecast Adjustment' table is designed to capture and manage modifications to sales forecasts, enabling businesses to refine their revenue projections based on updated insights or strategic decisions. This table facilitates better decision-making by providing a clear record of adjustments made to forecasts, ensuring alignment with current market conditions and organizational goals.

##### Columns

| Name | Data Type | Description (Generated) |
|------|-----------|-------------------------|
| `Forecast Adjustment` | `string` | The 'Forecast Adjustment' column captures qualitative modifications to the sales forecast, allowing for nuanced insights into expected revenue changes based on various influencing factors. |

##### Calculated Columns

**`Blank`** (`string`)

- **Description:** The 'Blank' column is intended to hold placeholder values or notes that may not currently contain data but are reserved for future use in the Opportunity Forecast Adjustment table.
- **DAX Expression:**
```dax
1
```
- **DAX Explanation (Generated):** The DAX expression you provided is simply the number `1`. 

In the context of a calculated column, this means that for every row in the table where this calculated column is added, the value of that column will be `1`. 

### What it achieves:
- **Uniform Value**: Every row will have the same value of `1`, which can be useful for various purposes, such as counting or aggregating data later.
- **Placeholder**: It can serve as a placeholder for future calculations or as a way to indicate that a certain condition is met for every row.

### Business Terms:
- If you think of a table as a list of transactions or records, this calculated column will simply add a new column where every entry shows `1`. This could be used to easily count the number of rows later, as summing this column would give you the total number of entries in the table. 

In summary, this DAX expression creates a calculated column that assigns the value `1` to every row, which can be useful for counting or as a base for further calculations.

##### Measures

**`Fcst adj slicer alt text`**

- **DAX Expression:**
```dax
CONCATENATE("Use the slicer to adjust the forecast, current value is ", 'Opportunity Forecast Adjustment'[Forecast Adjustment Value])
```
- **DAX Explanation (Generated):** This DAX code snippet is designed to create a text message that provides guidance to users interacting with a report or dashboard. Here's a breakdown of what it does in simple business terms:

1. **Purpose**: The measure generates a dynamic text message that informs users about how to interact with a slicer (a filtering tool) related to forecast adjustments.

2. **Message Content**: The text starts with "Use the slicer to adjust the forecast," which instructs users that they can modify the forecast values using the slicer.

3. **Current Value Display**: The phrase "current value is " is followed by a value pulled from the data model, specifically from the column `'Opportunity Forecast Adjustment'[Forecast Adjustment Value]`. This part of the code retrieves the current forecast adjustment value that is being displayed or used in the report.

4. **Final Output**: When combined, the entire output of this measure will look something like: "Use the slicer to adjust the forecast, current value is [actual value]." This message updates automatically based on the current value of the forecast adjustment, providing real-time feedback to users.

In summary, this DAX expression helps users understand how to interact with the forecast adjustment feature in the report by clearly stating the current adjustment value and encouraging them to use the slicer for further modifications.

**`Forecast Adjustment Value`**

- **DAX Expression:**
```dax
SELECTEDVALUE('Opportunity Forecast Adjustment'[Forecast Adjustment], 0)
```
- **DAX Explanation (Generated):** The DAX expression you've provided is used to retrieve a specific value from a column in a data table, and it has a fallback option if no value is selected. Here’s a breakdown of what it does in simple business terms:

1. **Context of Use**: This expression is likely used in a report or dashboard where users can select different options related to "Forecast Adjustments" for opportunities in a sales or forecasting context.

2. **SELECTEDVALUE Function**: The `SELECTEDVALUE` function is designed to return the value of a column when there is a single value selected. If there are multiple values selected or no value selected at all, it can return a default value instead.

3. **Column Reference**: In this case, the column being referenced is `'Opportunity Forecast Adjustment'[Forecast Adjustment]`. This means the function is looking at the "Forecast Adjustment" values from the "Opportunity Forecast Adjustment" table.

4. **Default Value**: The second part of the function, `0`, is the default value that will be returned if no single value is selected. This means if the user hasn’t made a specific selection or if there are multiple selections, the measure will default to 0.

### What It Achieves:
- **Single Value Retrieval**: The expression effectively retrieves the specific forecast adjustment value that a user has selected in the report.
- **Fallback to Zero**: If the user hasn’t selected a specific adjustment (either because they are looking at multiple adjustments or none), it ensures that the measure will still return a value (0 in this case), preventing errors or misleading results in calculations.

In summary, this DAX expression helps in dynamically capturing user-selected forecast adjustments while ensuring that the measure remains functional and meaningful even when no specific selection is made.

##### Measures

**`Rev Goal`**

- **DAX Expression:**
```dax
VAR RevenueInPipeline =
			    CALCULATE (
			        SUMX ( Opportunities, Opportunities[Value] ),
			        FILTER (
			            Opportunities,
			            Opportunities[Status] = "Open"
			            && VALUE(LEFT(Opportunities[Sales Stage],1)) >=2
			        )
			    )
			VAR BaseGoal =  
			MROUND(([Revenue Won]+ (RevenueInPipeline*.60)),1000000)    
			RETURN
			IF(BaseGoal > 0, BaseGoal, MROUND(([Revenue Won]+ (RevenueInPipeline*.60)),100000))
```
- **DAX Explanation (Generated):** This DAX code snippet is designed to calculate a revenue goal for a business based on current opportunities in the sales pipeline and previously won revenue. Here’s a breakdown of what it does in simple business terms:

1. **Calculate Revenue in Pipeline**:
   - The first part of the code calculates the total value of all "Open" opportunities in the sales pipeline. 
   - It filters the opportunities to include only those that are currently open and have a sales stage that indicates they are at least somewhat advanced (specifically, the first character of the sales stage must be '2' or higher).
   - The `SUMX` function is used to sum up the values of these filtered opportunities.

2. **Base Goal Calculation**:
   - Next, the code calculates a base revenue goal. This is done by taking the total revenue that has already been won (`Revenue Won`) and adding 60% of the revenue from the open opportunities calculated in the previous step (`RevenueInPipeline`).
   - The result is then rounded to the nearest million using the `MROUND` function.

3. **Final Goal Adjustment**:
   - Finally, the code checks if the calculated base goal is greater than zero. 
   - If it is, it returns this base goal. If not, it calculates a slightly adjusted goal by rounding the same base goal to the nearest hundred thousand instead.

### Summary:
In summary, this DAX measure calculates a revenue goal based on:
- The revenue already won.
- A portion (60%) of the potential revenue from open sales opportunities that are at an advanced stage.
- It ensures the goal is rounded to a meaningful figure (either to the nearest million or hundred thousand) and adjusts the goal if the calculated value is zero or negative. 

This measure helps businesses set realistic revenue targets based on both past performance and current sales opportunities.

##### Page Level Filters

- Filter on `Opportunities`.`Status` (Type: Categorical, Explanation: This Power BI filter definition is designed to focus on the `Status` of opportunities within a dataset. Here's a breakdown of what this filter does in simple business terms:

1. **Target Data**: The filter is applied to the `Opportunities` entity, specifically looking at the `Status` field of each opportunity.

2. **Included Statuses**: The filter specifies that only opportunities with a `Status` of either **'Lost'** or **'Won'** should be included in the analysis. 

3. **Exclusion of Other Statuses**: Any opportunities that have a `Status` other than 'Lost' or 'Won' will be excluded from the results. This means that statuses like 'Pending', 'In Progress', or any other status not mentioned will not be considered.

In summary, when this filter is applied, the analysis will only show opportunities that are either lost or won, effectively filtering out any opportunities that are still in progress or have not been finalized. This helps in focusing on the outcomes of opportunities rather than those that are still being worked on.)

##### Page Level Filters

- Filter on `Opportunity Calendar`.`RELATIVE MONTH` (Type: Advanced, Explanation: This Power BI filter definition is designed to refine the data displayed in the 'Opportunity Calendar' based on the 'RELATIVE MONTH' field. Let's break it down into simpler business terms:

1. **Target Data**: The filter is applied to the 'RELATIVE MONTH' column in the 'Opportunity Calendar' table. This column likely represents a time frame relative to the current date, such as months in the past or future.

2. **Inclusion Criteria**: The filter includes data where the 'RELATIVE MONTH' is greater than -18. This means it will include all records from the last 17 months up to the current month. For example, if today is October 2023, the filter will include data from May 2022 (which is -17) to October 2023 (which is 0).

3. **Exclusion Criteria**: The filter also excludes any records where the 'RELATIVE MONTH' is null. This means that if there are any entries in the 'Opportunity Calendar' that do not have a value for 'RELATIVE MONTH', those entries will not be included in the results.

### Summary:
In summary, this filter will show you all opportunities from the last 17 months up to the current month, while ensuring that any opportunities without a specified month are left out. This helps in focusing on relevant and complete data for analysis.)

- Filter on `Products`.`Product Category` (Type: Categorical, Definition: N/A)
- Filter on `Industries`.`Industry` (Type: Advanced, Definition: N/A)
- Filter on `Industries`.`IndustrySeq` (Type: Advanced, Explanation: This Power BI filter definition is designed to control which records from the `Industries` table are included in the analysis based on the `IndustrySeq` field. Let's break it down into simpler terms:

### What the Filter Does:

1. **Target Field**: The filter specifically targets the `IndustrySeq` column in the `Industries` table.

2. **Inclusion Criteria**: The filter includes records where the `IndustrySeq` is neither `0` nor `null`. 

### Detailed Explanation:

- **Exclusion of `0`**: The filter explicitly states that any record with an `IndustrySeq` value of `0` should be excluded from the results. This means that if a record has an `IndustrySeq` of `0`, it will not be part of the data being analyzed.

- **Exclusion of `null`**: Similarly, the filter also excludes any record where the `IndustrySeq` is `null`. A `null` value typically indicates that there is no valid data for that field, so these records will also be left out of the analysis.

### Summary:

In summary, when this filter is applied, it ensures that only records from the `Industries` table with a valid `IndustrySeq` (i.e., any value other than `0` or `null`) are included in the analysis. This helps in focusing on meaningful data and avoids any records that might not provide useful insights.)

2. **Filter Condition**: The filter is set to include only those records where the "RELATIVE MONTH" is equal to "0L". In this context, "0L" typically represents the current month. 

3. **Inclusion/Exclusion**: 
   - **Included**: Only the opportunities that fall within the current month will be included in the analysis or report.
   - **Excluded**: Opportunities from any other months (past or future) will be excluded from the results.

In summary, this filter is used to narrow down the data to only show opportunities that are relevant to the current month, allowing users to focus on the most immediate and relevant opportunities in their analysis.)

  - Filter on `Industries`.`Industry` (Type: TopN, Explanation: This Power BI filter definition JSON is designed to filter data based on the `Industry` field from the `Industries` table. Here's a simplified explanation of what this filter does:

### Overview of the Filter

1. **Purpose**: The filter aims to include only specific industries from the `Industries` table based on a related dataset from the `Opportunities` table.

2. **Data Selection**: 
   - The filter first identifies the top 5 industries that have generated the highest revenue from the `Opportunities` table. This is done by:
     - Looking at the `Industries` table to get the `Industry` names.
     - Joining this with the `Opportunities` table to assess the `Revenue Won` for each industry.
     - Sorting these industries by their revenue in descending order to find the top 5.

3. **Inclusion Criteria**: 
   - After determining the top 5 industries based on revenue, the filter then applies this selection to the `Industries` table. 
   - It includes only those industries that are part of this top 5 list.

### Summary of Data Included or Excluded

- **Included**: Only the industries that rank among the top 5 in terms of revenue won from opportunities.
- **Excluded**: Any industries that do not fall within this top 5 ranking based on revenue.

### Business Implication

In practical business terms, this filter allows decision-makers to focus their analysis and reporting on the most successful industries in terms of revenue generation. By filtering out less successful industries, the organization can better understand and strategize around its most profitable sectors.)

Let's break it down in simple business terms:

1. **Target Data**: The filter is applied to the "RELATIVE MONTH" column within the "Opportunity Calendar" data. This column likely represents a time frame in relation to the current date, such as "this month," "last month," or "next month."

2. **Filter Condition**: The filter specifies a condition that compares the "RELATIVE MONTH" value to a specific number. In this case, the number is "0L," which typically represents the current month in relative terms.

3. **Inclusion Criteria**: By setting the filter to "0L," the filter is including only those records from the "Opportunity Calendar" where the "RELATIVE MONTH" is equal to the current month. 

4. **Exclusion Criteria**: Any records that do not fall within the current month (i.e., records where "RELATIVE MONTH" is less than or greater than 0) will be excluded from the data set.

In summary, this filter is used to isolate and display only the opportunities that are relevant to the current month, allowing users to focus on the most immediate and relevant data for their analysis.)

##### Page Level Filters

- Filter on `Opportunities`.`Status` (Type: Categorical, Explanation: This Power BI filter definition JSON is designed to focus on the `Status` field of the `Opportunities` entity. Let's break it down in simple business terms:

1. **Target Data**: The filter is specifically looking at the `Status` of opportunities in a business context. Opportunities typically refer to potential sales or deals that a company is pursuing.

2. **Inclusion Criteria**: The filter is set to include only those opportunities that have a `Status` of "Open." This means that any opportunity that is currently active and has not yet been closed or won will be included in the analysis.

3. **Exclusion Criteria**: Conversely, any opportunities that have a `Status` other than "Open" (such as "Closed," "Won," or "Lost") will be excluded from the data being analyzed. 

In summary, when this filter is applied, it ensures that only the active, ongoing opportunities are considered, allowing for focused analysis on current potential sales rather than completed or inactive ones.)

- Filter on `Industries`.`Industry` (Type: Categorical, Explanation: This Power BI filter definition is designed to control which data is included when analyzing the `Industries`.`Industry` field. Let's break it down in simple business terms:

1. **Target Data**: The filter is applied to the `Industry` column within the `Industries` table.

2. **Filter Logic**: The filter specifies a condition that excludes certain data. Specifically, it is looking for entries in the `Industry` column that do **not** match a specific value.

3. **Excluded Value**: The value that is being excluded from the analysis is `'n/a'`. This typically represents "not applicable" or "not available," which may not be relevant for the analysis.

4. **Result of the Filter**: When this filter is applied, any records in the `Industries` table where the `Industry` is `'n/a'` will be excluded from the results. This means that only industries with valid, applicable names will be included in any reports or visualizations.

In summary, this filter ensures that the analysis focuses on meaningful industry data by filtering out any entries that are marked as `'n/a'`.)

  - Filter on `Opportunities`.`[Close %]` (Type: Advanced, Definition: N/A)
  - Filter on `Industries`.`Industry` (Type: TopN, Explanation: This Power BI filter definition JSON is designed to filter data based on the `Industry` field from the `Industries` table. Here’s a simplified explanation of what this filter does in business terms:

### Key Components of the Filter:

1. **Source Tables**:
   - The filter involves two tables: `Industries` and `Opportunities`.
   - `Industries` contains various industry categories.
   - `Opportunities` likely contains sales or business opportunities associated with those industries.

2. **Subquery**:
   - The filter uses a subquery to identify specific industries based on their associated revenue from the `Opportunities` table.
   - It selects the top 5 industries that have the highest revenue from open opportunities.

3. **Filtering Logic**:
   - The main filtering condition checks if the `Industry` from the `Industries` table is included in the list of industries returned by the subquery.
   - Essentially, it filters the `Industries` table to only include those industries that are among the top 5 in terms of revenue from open opportunities.

### What Data is Included or Excluded:

- **Included**: 
  - Only the industries that are in the top 5 based on the revenue from open opportunities will be included in the final dataset. This means if an industry is performing well (high revenue), it will be part of the analysis.

- **Excluded**: 
  - Any industry that does not rank in the top 5 for revenue from open opportunities will be excluded from the dataset. This helps focus the analysis on the most lucrative industries.

### Summary:
In summary, this filter is used to narrow down the analysis to only those industries that are currently generating significant revenue from open opportunities, allowing businesses to focus on their most profitable sectors.)

##### Page Level Filters

- Filter on `Opportunities`.`Status` (Type: Categorical, Explanation: This Power BI filter definition JSON is designed to focus on the `Status` field within the `Opportunities` entity. Here’s a breakdown of what this filter does in simple business terms:

1. **Target Data**: The filter specifically targets the `Opportunities` data, which likely represents potential sales or deals that a business is tracking.

2. **Filtering Criteria**: The filter is set to include only those opportunities that have a `Status` of "Won". This means that any opportunity that has been successfully closed and marked as won will be included in the analysis.

3. **Exclusion of Other Data**: Conversely, any opportunities that are not marked as "Won" (such as those that are still open, lost, or in progress) will be excluded from the results when this filter is applied.

In summary, when this filter is applied, the analysis will only show opportunities that have been successfully won, allowing users to focus on successful sales outcomes.)

  - Filter on (Name: `Filter9eafa29b773622144b40`) (Type: Exclude, Explanation: This Power BI filter definition is designed to control which data from the "Campaigns" entity is included in a report or visualization. Let's break it down in simple business terms:

1. **Source of Data**: The filter is applied to a data source named "c," which represents the "Campaigns" entity. This means that the filter is specifically looking at data related to marketing campaigns.

2. **Filter Condition**: The main condition of this filter is to **exclude** certain data. Specifically, it is looking for records where the "Campaign" field does not have a value of "null." 

3. **What is Excluded**: In practical terms, this means that any campaign records that do not have a specified campaign name (i.e., those that are marked as "null") will be excluded from the results. 

4. **What is Included**: As a result, only campaigns that have a valid name or identifier will be included in the report or visualization. This helps ensure that the analysis focuses on meaningful data, avoiding any entries that lack essential information.

In summary, this filter is set up to ensure that only campaigns with valid names are considered in the analysis, effectively filtering out any incomplete or irrelevant campaign data.)

##### Page Level Filters

- Filter on `Opportunities`.`Status` (Type: Categorical, Explanation: This Power BI filter definition is designed to control which records from the `Opportunities` dataset are included in your analysis based on the `Status` of each opportunity.

### Breakdown of the Filter:

1. **Target Entity**: The filter is applied to the `Opportunities` entity, which contains various records of sales opportunities.

2. **Filter Logic**: The filter specifically focuses on the `Status` field of these opportunities.

3. **Condition**: The key part of this filter is the condition that states:
   - **"Not In"**: This means that we want to exclude certain values from our results.
   - The filter is set to exclude opportunities where the `Status` is `'Lost'`.

### What This Means for Your Data:

- **Included Data**: When this filter is applied, you will see all opportunities except those that have a `Status` of `'Lost'`. This means you will be looking at opportunities that are still active, won, or in any other status that is not classified as lost.

- **Excluded Data**: Any opportunity that has been marked as `'Lost'` will not be included in your analysis. This helps in focusing on opportunities that are still viable for sales efforts or reporting.

### Summary:

In simple terms, this filter helps you focus on the opportunities that are still worth pursuing by filtering out those that have already been lost. This can be particularly useful for sales teams looking to analyze their current pipeline without the noise of lost opportunities.)

##### Page Level Filters

- Filter on `Opportunities`.`Status` (Type: Categorical, Explanation: This Power BI filter definition is designed to focus on specific statuses of opportunities within a dataset. Here's a breakdown of what this filter does in simple business terms:

1. **Target Data**: The filter is applied to the `Status` field of the `Opportunities` entity. This means it is looking at the current status of various sales opportunities.

2. **Included Statuses**: The filter specifies that only opportunities with a status of either **"Open"** or **"Won"** should be included in the analysis. 

3. **Exclusion of Other Statuses**: Any opportunities that have a status other than "Open" or "Won" will be excluded from the results. This means that if an opportunity is marked as "Closed," "Lost," or any other status, it will not be considered in the data being analyzed.

In summary, this filter is used to narrow down the dataset to only those opportunities that are currently active (Open) or have been successfully completed (Won), allowing for focused analysis on these specific stages of the sales process.)
- Filter on `Opportunity Calendar`.`RELATIVE MONTH` (Type: Advanced, Explanation: This Power BI filter definition is designed to control which records from the "Opportunity Calendar" are included based on the "RELATIVE MONTH" field. Let's break it down into simpler business terms:

1. **Target Data**: The filter is applied to the "RELATIVE MONTH" column in the "Opportunity Calendar" table. This column likely represents a time frame relative to the current date (e.g., months before or after today).

2. **Inclusion Criteria**: 
   - The filter specifies that we want to include records where the "RELATIVE MONTH" is greater than or equal to -6. This means we are looking for opportunities that occurred in the last 6 months, including the current month. 
   - In practical terms, if today is October 2023, this filter will include data from April 2023 to October 2023.

3. **Exclusion Criteria**: 
   - The filter also specifies that we want to exclude any records where the "RELATIVE MONTH" is null (i.e., there is no value present). This ensures that we are only looking at records that have a valid month value.

### Summary:
In summary, this filter will include all opportunities from the last 6 months (from the current month back to 6 months prior) while excluding any records that do not have a specified month. This helps in analyzing recent opportunities without cluttering the data with incomplete records.)

2. **Filter Condition**: The filter is set to include only those opportunities where the `Status` is `'Open'`. 

3. **Inclusion Criteria**: 
   - The filter checks the `Status` of each opportunity.
   - It specifically looks for opportunities that are currently marked as `'Open'`.

4. **Exclusion Criteria**: 
   - Any opportunities that have a `Status` other than `'Open'` (such as `'Closed'`, `'Won'`, or `'Lost'`) will be excluded from the data being analyzed.

In summary, when this filter is applied, the resulting data will only show opportunities that are currently open, allowing users to focus on potential sales or deals that are still active.)

- Visual Level Filters:
  - Filter on `Owners`.`[Rev Goal]` (Type: Advanced, Explanation: This Power BI filter definition is designed to focus on the data related to the `Rev Goal` (Revenue Goal) for the `Owners` entity. Let's break it down in simple business terms:

1. **Target Data**: The filter is specifically applied to the `Rev Goal` measure within the `Owners` data. This means we are looking at the revenue goals set for different owners.

2. **Filter Condition**: The filter is set to include only those records where the `Rev Goal` is greater than 0 million (0M). In other words, it is filtering out any owners whose revenue goals are zero or negative.

3. **Inclusion and Exclusion**:
   - **Included**: Owners who have a revenue goal that is greater than 0 million. This means we are interested in owners who are aiming to achieve some level of revenue.
   - **Excluded**: Owners with a revenue goal of 0 million or less. This means any owner who does not have a revenue target or has a negative target will not be considered in the analysis.

In summary, this filter helps to focus on the owners who are actively setting revenue goals, allowing for a more targeted analysis of performance and strategy among those who are aiming to generate revenue.)

1. **Target Data**: The filter is applied to the "Rev Goal" measure within the "Owners" dataset. This measure represents the revenue goals set for different owners.

2. **Filter Condition**: The filter specifies a condition that compares the "Rev Goal" to a specific value. In this case, it is checking if the "Rev Goal" is greater than 0 million (0M).

3. **Inclusion/Exclusion**:
   - **Included**: Only those records (owners) whose revenue goals are greater than 0 million will be included in the analysis or report.
   - **Excluded**: Any owners with a revenue goal of 0 million or less will be excluded from the results.

In summary, this filter ensures that the analysis focuses solely on owners who have set a positive revenue goal, effectively filtering out any owners who do not have a revenue target or have a target that is zero or negative.)

##### Page Level Filters

- Filter on `Opportunities`.`Status` (Type: Categorical, Explanation: This Power BI filter definition is designed to focus on the `Status` of opportunities within a dataset. Here's a breakdown of what this filter does in simple business terms:

1. **Target Data**: The filter is applied to the `Opportunities` entity, specifically looking at the `Status` field of each opportunity.

2. **Included Statuses**: The filter specifies that only opportunities with a `Status` of either **'Open'** or **'Won'** should be included in the analysis. 

3. **Exclusion of Other Statuses**: Any opportunities that have a `Status` other than 'Open' or 'Won' will be excluded from the results. This means that if an opportunity is marked as 'Closed', 'Lost', or any other status, it will not be considered in the filtered data.

In summary, when this filter is applied, you will only see opportunities that are currently active (Open) or have been successfully completed (Won), allowing for a focused analysis on these specific stages of opportunity management.)
- Filter on `Opportunity Calendar`.`RELATIVE MONTH` (Type: Advanced, Explanation: This Power BI filter definition is designed to include specific data from the "Opportunity Calendar" based on the "RELATIVE MONTH" field. Let's break it down into simpler business terms:

1. **Target Data**: The filter is applied to the "RELATIVE MONTH" column in the "Opportunity Calendar" table. This column likely represents a time frame relative to the current date (e.g., months before or after today).

2. **Inclusion Criteria**:
   - The filter includes records where the "RELATIVE MONTH" is greater than or equal to **-6**. This means it will include data from the last 6 months leading up to the current month. For example, if today is October 2023, it will include data from April 2023 to October 2023.
   
3. **Exclusion Criteria**:
   - The filter also excludes any records where the "RELATIVE MONTH" is **null**. This means that if there are any entries in the "Opportunity Calendar" that do not have a value for "RELATIVE MONTH," those entries will not be included in the results.

### Summary:
In summary, this filter will include all opportunities from the last 6 months (up to the current month) while excluding any opportunities that do not have a specified month. This helps ensure that the analysis focuses on relevant, time-bound data without any gaps or missing values.)

##### Page Level Filters

- Filter on `Opportunity Calendar`.`RELATIVE MONTH` (Type: Advanced, Explanation: This Power BI filter definition is designed to focus on a specific range of data from the `Opportunity Calendar` based on the `RELATIVE MONTH` field. Let's break it down in simple business terms:

### What the Filter Does:
1. **Target Field**: The filter is applied to the `RELATIVE MONTH` column in the `Opportunity Calendar` table. This column likely represents the number of months relative to the current month (e.g., -1 for last month, 0 for the current month, +1 for next month).

2. **Inclusion Criteria**: The filter specifies a range of months:
   - It includes data where the `RELATIVE MONTH` is greater than or equal to **-16** (which means it includes data from 16 months ago).
   - It also includes data where the `RELATIVE MONTH` is less than or equal to **0** (which means it includes data up to the current month).

### Summary of Included Data:
- The filter effectively includes all opportunities from **16 months ago** up to **the current month**. 

### Excluded Data:
- Any opportunities that occurred **more than 16 months ago** (i.e., `RELATIVE MONTH` less than -16) or **after the current month** (i.e., `RELATIVE MONTH` greater than 0) are excluded from the results.

### Practical Implication:
If you were analyzing sales opportunities, this filter would allow you to focus on a relevant time frame of the last 16 months leading up to now, helping you understand trends, performance, or other metrics without being influenced by older or future data.)

- Visual Level Filters:
  - Filter on `Opportunity Calendar`.`RELATIVE MONTH` (Type: Advanced, Explanation: This Power BI filter definition is designed to focus on the `RELATIVE MONTH` field within the `Opportunity Calendar` data. Let's break it down in simple business terms:

1. **Target Data**: The filter is applied to the `RELATIVE MONTH` column in the `Opportunity Calendar` table. This column likely represents a time frame relative to the current date, such as "this month," "last month," or "next month."

2. **Filter Logic**: The filter is set to include only those records where the `RELATIVE MONTH` is greater than or equal to -12. In practical terms, this means:
   - The filter is looking back 12 months from the current date.
   - It includes all data from the current month and the previous 12 months (i.e., from the current month back to the same month last year).

3. **Exclusion**: Any records that fall outside this 12-month window will be excluded. For example, if the current month is October 2023, the filter will include data from October 2023 back to October 2022, but it will exclude any data from before October 2022.

In summary, this filter is used to analyze opportunities that have occurred over the past year, ensuring that only relevant, recent data is considered for reporting or analysis.)

  - Filter on `Opportunity Calendar`.`RELATIVE MONTH` (Type: Advanced, Explanation: This Power BI filter definition is designed to focus on a specific time frame within the "Opportunity Calendar" data, specifically the "RELATIVE MONTH" field. Here’s a breakdown of what this filter does in simple business terms:

1. **Target Data**: The filter is applied to the "RELATIVE MONTH" column in the "Opportunity Calendar" table. This column likely represents a time period relative to the current date (e.g., months before or after today).

2. **Filter Condition**: The filter is set to include only those records where the "RELATIVE MONTH" is less than or equal to -16. 

3. **Understanding the Value**: The value "-16L" indicates that the filter is looking for months that are 16 months prior to the current month. In other words, it is excluding any opportunities that occurred in the last 16 months or are more recent.

4. **Inclusion/Exclusion**: 
   - **Included**: Opportunities that occurred 17 months ago or earlier (i.e., any month before the 16-month threshold).
   - **Excluded**: Opportunities that occurred within the last 16 months (from the current month back to 16 months ago).

In summary, this filter is used to analyze historical data by focusing on opportunities that are older than 16 months, effectively filtering out more recent opportunities from the analysis.)

### What the Filter Does:
1. **Target Field**: The filter is applied to the "RELATIVE MONTH" field in the "Opportunity Calendar" entity. This field likely represents the month relative to the current date (e.g., current month = 0, previous month = -1, next month = 1).

2. **Inclusion Criteria**: The filter is set to include only those records where the "RELATIVE MONTH" is equal to 0. This means:
   - **Current Month**: The filter is specifically looking for opportunities that are occurring in the current month.

3. **Exclusion Criteria**: By focusing solely on "RELATIVE MONTH" = 0, the filter inherently excludes:
   - Any opportunities from previous months (e.g., -1, -2, etc.).
   - Any opportunities from future months (e.g., 1, 2, etc.).

### Summary:
In summary, this filter is designed to show only the opportunities that are happening in the current month, while excluding all opportunities from any other months. This is useful for analyzing current performance and activities without the influence of past or future data.)

  - Filter on `Opportunities`.`OpportunitySeq` (Type: Advanced, Definition: N/A)
  - Filter on `Opportunity Calendar`.`RELATIVE MONTH` (Type: Advanced, Explanation: This Power BI filter definition is designed to focus on a specific aspect of the data related to the "Opportunity Calendar" entity, particularly the "RELATIVE MONTH" field. Let's break it down in simple business terms:

1. **Target Data**: The filter is applied to the "RELATIVE MONTH" column in the "Opportunity Calendar" data. This column likely represents a time frame in relation to the current date, such as months before or after the present month.

2. **Filter Condition**: The filter specifies a condition that compares the "RELATIVE MONTH" value to a specific number. In this case, the filter is looking for records where the "RELATIVE MONTH" is **greater than -20**.

3. **What Does -20 Mean?**: The value "-20" indicates a relative month that is 20 months before the current month. So, if today is October 2023, -20 would refer to February 2022.

4. **Inclusion of Data**: By applying this filter, the data included will be all records from the "Opportunity Calendar" where the "RELATIVE MONTH" is greater than -20. This means it will include all records from February 2022 onward up to the current month (October 2023).

5. **Exclusion of Data**: Consequently, any records that have a "RELATIVE MONTH" value of -20 or less (which would be any month before February 2022) will be excluded from the results.

In summary, this filter is set up to include all opportunities from February 2022 to the present month, effectively focusing on a recent time frame while excluding older data.)

1. **Target Data**: The filter is applied to the "RELATIVE MONTH" column in the "Opportunity Calendar" table. This column likely represents a time period relative to the current date (e.g., current month, last month, next month, etc.).

2. **Filter Condition**: The filter is set to include only those records where the "RELATIVE MONTH" is less than or equal to -20. 

3. **Understanding the Value**: The value "-20L" indicates that the filter is looking for months that are 20 months prior to the current month. In practical terms, if today is October 2023, the filter would include data from February 2022 and earlier.

4. **Inclusion and Exclusion**: 
   - **Included**: Any records from the "Opportunity Calendar" that fall within the time frame of February 2022 and earlier.
   - **Excluded**: Any records from March 2022 onward.

In summary, this filter is used to analyze opportunities that are significantly older than the current date, specifically those that are 20 months or more in the past. This could be useful for reviewing historical data or assessing long-term trends in opportunities.)

### What the Filter Does:

1. **Target Data**: The filter is applied to the "RELATIVE MONTH" column in the "Opportunity Calendar" table. This column likely represents the month relative to the current date (e.g., current month = 0, previous month = -1, next month = 1).

2. **Inclusion Criteria**: The filter is set to include only those records where the "RELATIVE MONTH" is equal to 0. This means:
   - **Current Month**: The filter is specifically looking for opportunities that are occurring in the current month.

3. **Exclusion Criteria**: Since the filter only includes records where "RELATIVE MONTH" is 0, it effectively excludes:
   - Any opportunities from previous months (e.g., -1, -2, etc.).
   - Any opportunities from future months (e.g., 1, 2, etc.).

### Summary:

In summary, when this filter is applied, it will show only the opportunities that are relevant to the current month, filtering out any data from past or future months. This is useful for businesses that want to focus on their current sales pipeline or opportunities that are active right now.)

- Filter on `Opportunities`.`Status` (Type: Categorical, Explanation: This Power BI filter definition is designed to focus on the `Status` of opportunities within a dataset. Here’s a breakdown of what this filter does in simple business terms:

1. **Target Data**: The filter is applied to the `Opportunities` entity, specifically looking at the `Status` field of each opportunity.

2. **Included Statuses**: The filter specifies that only opportunities with a `Status` of either **'Lost'** or **'Won'** should be included in the analysis. 

3. **Exclusion of Other Statuses**: Any opportunities that have a `Status` other than 'Lost' or 'Won' will be excluded from the results. This means that statuses like 'Pending', 'In Progress', or any other status not specified will not be considered in the data being analyzed.

In summary, when this filter is applied, you will only see opportunities that are either marked as 'Lost' or 'Won', allowing for a focused analysis on these two outcomes.)

##### Page Level Filters

- Filter on `Opportunity Calendar`.`RELATIVE MONTH` (Type: Advanced, Explanation: This Power BI filter definition is designed to focus on a specific subset of data from the "Opportunity Calendar" table, specifically targeting the "RELATIVE MONTH" field. Let's break down what this filter does in simple business terms:

1. **Target Data**: The filter is applied to the "RELATIVE MONTH" column in the "Opportunity Calendar" table. This column likely represents the month relative to a certain point in time (e.g., current month, last month, etc.).

2. **Inclusion Criteria**: The filter includes data where the "RELATIVE MONTH" is greater than or equal to -8. In practical terms, this means:
   - It includes data from the current month (0) and the previous 8 months (i.e., from month 0 to month -8).
   - For example, if the current month is October (0), the filter will include data from October (0), September (-1), August (-2), July (-3), June (-4), May (-5), April (-6), March (-7), and February (-8).

3. **Exclusion Criteria**: The filter also excludes any records where the "RELATIVE MONTH" is null. This means:
   - If there are any entries in the "Opportunity Calendar" where the "RELATIVE MONTH" is not specified (i.e., it has no value), those entries will not be included in the results.

### Summary:
In summary, this filter will include all opportunities from the current month back to 8 months ago, while ensuring that any records without a specified month are excluded. This helps in analyzing opportunities within a defined recent timeframe, providing a clearer view of performance and trends over the last 9 months.)

- Visual Level Filters:
  - Filter on `Owners`.`[Rev Goal]` (Type: Advanced, Explanation: This Power BI filter definition is designed to focus on the `Rev Goal` (Revenue Goal) data for the `Owners` entity. Here's a breakdown of what this filter does in simple business terms:

1. **Target Data**: The filter is applied to the `Rev Goal` measure within the `Owners` dataset. This measure represents the revenue goals set for different owners.

2. **Condition**: The filter specifies a condition that compares the `Rev Goal` value to a specific threshold. In this case, the threshold is `0M`, which stands for zero million.

3. **Inclusion Criteria**: The filter includes only those records where the `Rev Goal` is greater than `0M`. This means that any owner with a revenue goal that is zero or negative will be excluded from the analysis.

4. **Business Implication**: By applying this filter, the analysis will focus solely on owners who have a positive revenue goal. This can help in understanding performance, setting targets, or making strategic decisions based on owners who are actively aiming to achieve revenue growth.

In summary, this filter ensures that only owners with a revenue goal greater than zero are considered in the analysis, effectively excluding those without a positive revenue target.)

  - Filter on `Owners`.`[Rev Goal]` (Type: Advanced, Explanation: This Power BI filter definition JSON is designed to apply a specific condition to the data related to the `Rev Goal` (Revenue Goal) for the `Owners` entity. Let's break it down in simple business terms:

1. **Target Data**: The filter is focused on the `Rev Goal` measure from the `Owners` data set. This measure typically represents the revenue targets set for different owners or entities.

2. **Condition Applied**: The filter specifies a condition that compares the `Rev Goal` value to a specific threshold. In this case, the threshold is `0M`, which stands for zero million (essentially, zero revenue goal).

3. **What Data is Included or Excluded**:
   - **Included**: The filter will include only those records from the `Owners` entity where the `Rev Goal` is greater than zero. This means that any owner with a revenue goal set above zero will be considered in the analysis.
   - **Excluded**: Conversely, any owner whose `Rev Goal` is zero or less will be excluded from the analysis. This helps focus on owners who have active revenue targets and are likely contributing to revenue generation.

In summary, this filter is used to ensure that only owners with a positive revenue goal are included in the analysis, allowing for a more targeted view of performance and potential revenue contributions.)

- Visual Level Filters:
  - Filter on `Opportunity Calendar`.`RELATIVE MONTH` (Type: Advanced, Explanation: This Power BI filter definition is designed to focus on a specific aspect of the data related to the "Opportunity Calendar" entity, particularly the "RELATIVE MONTH" field. Let's break it down in simple business terms:

1. **Target Data**: The filter is applied to the "RELATIVE MONTH" column within the "Opportunity Calendar" data. This column likely represents a time frame in relation to the current date, such as "this month," "last month," or "next month."

2. **Filter Condition**: The filter specifies a condition that compares the "RELATIVE MONTH" value to a specific number. In this case, the number is "0L," which typically represents the current month in relative terms.

3. **What Data is Included**: By applying this filter, the data being included will only be those records from the "Opportunity Calendar" where the "RELATIVE MONTH" is equal to "0L." This means that only the opportunities that are relevant to the current month will be considered.

4. **What Data is Excluded**: Any records from the "Opportunity Calendar" that do not have a "RELATIVE MONTH" value of "0L" will be excluded. This includes opportunities from previous months (like "1L" for last month) or future months (like "1R" for next month).

In summary, this filter is set up to show only the opportunities that are happening in the current month, filtering out any data from other months.)
